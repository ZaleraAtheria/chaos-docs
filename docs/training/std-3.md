# Veteran Promotion Requirements

At this point, the trainee should have already finished their initial renegade training (sections 1-3 can be found here) and one of the divisional trainings (sections 4-5 can be found here

They also should:
+ Be an active member in the group for at LEAST 14 days after attaining the rank of Renegade
+ Be recommended for promotion by at least 2 active members of Marauder rank or higher.

After the above requirements have been met, the trainee should be promoted to Veteran. THEN they may continue their training below.

Keep in mind, they will have to complete section 5 to be eligible for promotion to Marauder but get them through section 6 first if possible.

### PARAPHRASE / TEACH THE FOLLOWING!
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

#### Flamer
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 1
+ Fires FIRE. 3 modes
  + '1' to increase pressure, '2' to decrease
    + Max - Flames bounce once
    + Med - Flames do not bounce
    + Min - Sprays Fuel that can be lit with other fire sources
      + Flamer, Inferno grenade, plasma, backblast from planes/assault pack
+ FIRE DOES AT!

#### Flamer Fuel Pack (Marauder rank - Ferrum)
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Increase fuel capacity (from 25 to 100 units)
+ Reload turns into recharge over time
+ May reload below 25 units of fuel (2.5 seconds)
+ Changing to flamer from other weapon initiates reload animation


#### Bolter
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 1
+ Full-auto explosive rounds.
  + Explosion deals partial damage in 2m radius
  + 24 bolts/mag,
  + 40-round belt available as unlockable wargear.
    + Switch magazine types with /1 mag
  + Belt lowers fire rate and accuracy. This is true of any belt mag.
+ Bayonet available (/1 bayo)

The bolter is a potent suppression weapon that can also act as a force multiplier when we have the high ground. The bullets will detonate as small explosions, so if you haven't worked it out, shooting down at people allows you to levy the explosive ammunition to its full potential and aim at the ground of where someone is going to better secure a kill.


#### Heavy Bolter
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 1
+ Is essentially a heavy stubber with bolter rounds and a 60 round mag.
+ Exploding rounds means higher position relative to a target = better.
+ Can deploy for more accuracy (press C) on almost any cover from around your knees to your nips in height.


#### Bolt Pistol
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Is exactly what you think it is.
+ Semi-auto, 8 rounds in the magazine.
+ Exploding rounds means higher position relative to a target = better.
+ Optional 16-round belt mags are available as unlockable wargear.
  + Switch magazine types with /1 mag


#### Battle Standard
  {: .no_toc .text-delta }
  + 5m range melee.
  + Can be planted with Q.
  + Hands applications to people that click it.


#### MeltaGun
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 3
+ Deals AT and LL damage in a short-range line directly in front of you
  + Effective range of 15 meters
  + Damage grows and shrinks depending on how close you are to the target
+ Instead of ammunition it uses a pool of 30 units of energy, which recharges when not in use.

Meltas do not like armor. If you get close enough to anything, the melta will kill it. A meltagun in the middle of high-HP enemy deployables with an inferno already on their teleporter can really fuck with their front line.

As above, unless you have someone doing a good job stopping aircraft, don't just assume you don't have a responsibility to switch weapons to give the group a better edge. Stay aware of the situation, with the meltagun especially.


#### Catachan Pattern Grenade Launcher
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 3
+ Fires six grenades per mag in a parabolic arc.
+ Controls:
  + Left click to fire.
  + ‘R’ to reload or confirm cycled grenade type. Reloads one grenade at a time, fire at any point to cancel the reload.
  + ‘1’ to cycle grenade type forward
  + '2' to cycle grenade type backward

Our grenade launcher is very similar to the mortar, though it has slightly more utility. A more skill based weapon, the launcher has six shells to fire that must each be manually loaded, but this means that each shell can be fired after a reload of a single shell has finished. Much like the mortar, each round fulfills a similar purpose.

#### Chainsword
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ 5m range
+ Hold C to grind (Gradual AT delivery and partial avatar damage)
+ Tap/let go of C to do instant kill (avatars)
+ Collects skulls.

## S5, II. Veteran Vehicles

### PARAPHRASE / TEACH THE FOLLOWING:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

#### Leman Russ Main Battle Tank
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

The Leman Russ is a bull compared to the Chimera. It is slimmer, taller, heavier, slower, and has more firepower. It can act both as a base of fire by getting to a good position and suppressing or killing through volume of fire, or can completely disrupt a line by breaking into a formation and being a distraction and killing what it has to. Explain the Leman Russ is one of the heaviest tanks in the SLMC, meaning it can ram into other tanks and shock the enemy or disrupt their ability to attack effectively

Practice driving the Leman Russ around the sim. Explain that tanks are a fundamental part of heavy support. As a veteran, they are the first ones expected to respond to a call for a tank, and are usually expected to deploy the Leman Russ. Reiterate once again the importance of deploying with the correct HP type (LBA or LBA Lite) in the midst of combat.

#### Controls:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ On first attach, you will be presented with a popup menu of options and a list of commands in local. These can be accessed again by typing /1 menu and /1 vhelp respectively.
+ /1hp Sets how much health of what type you’ll deploy with
+ /1 wep allows you to select which hull mount you'll deploy with. Selecting a new hull weapon will issue a temp attach request to the user. The user must accept the temp attachment in order to use the hull mount (or sponson).
  + Hull mounted weapons:
    + Heavy Bolter: Exactly like the one on the Chimera
    + Heavy Flamer: Ditto
    + Lascannon: Bruh same
    + Autocannon (leave this blank until we know what it actually does):
    + Whatever the hell else Dread tech-heresies in here:
+ /1 sponsons will attach sponson turrets to either side of the tank, and allows you to select what they are. These are effectively 2 further hull-mounted weapons of your choice. This option WILL reduce the speed and turning rate of the vehicle.
+ /1 dozer will attach a bulldozer blade to the front of the vehicle. This will allow your vehicle rams to cause LBA damage (5 damage per tick) to whatever you strike and continue to push into. These also incur a speed and mobility penalty to the vehicle, which stacks with the sponson penalty.


+ Left click to fire coaxial heavy stubber (where applicable) or main turret weapon for turrets that do not possess a co-ax.
+ ‘E’ to fire hull-mounted weapon
+ ‘C’ to fire main turret weapon on turrets that possess a coaxial stubber
+ ‘1’ to select cannon shell (if applicable)
  + HE operates similarly to a fragmentation rocket, and is used for anti-infantry.
  + AP delivers 50 AT to whatever it strikes, and 10 AT on a splash.

Have them get used to the controls and do a skirmish. Make sure they understand that they should prioritizing facing towards anything they want to kill so all three weapons are able to fire and that their only LBA munition is the main cannon and heavy flamer (if equipped).

#### Alternative Turrets:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Alternative turrets are purchased with corruption.

+ Vanquisher Turret:
  + Primarily an anti-tank turret with high burst damage. Has no HE shells.
  + Vanquisher shells deal 80 AT per shot on a direct hit, 15 on a splash.
  + Beast hunter shells deal 35 AT on a direct hit and have no splash. Instead they deploy pools of bio-mutagenic acid (as the acid grenade). A shell that directly hits a scripted object with an NPC flag will instead deal 90 AT.
  + Has a coaxial stubber.


+ Annihilator Turret:
    + Solely an anti-tank turret, as the only weaponry it has are twin-linked lascannons. Bring backup to deal with infantry or die a fool's death.
    + Deals 25 AT per shot with the safety toggled on.
    + Press 1 to turn the safety protocols off. With safety off, every shot will deal 35 damage and build 16 heat. At 100 heat, the tank will start dealing damage to itself. At 200 heat, the turret **will** shut down until heat falls below 100.


+ Exterminator Turret:
    + Bearing a twin-linked autocannon, this is a hybrid anti-tank/anti-infantry turret with a lean towards anti-infantry.
    + The autocannon rounds are exactly the same as those in the chimera, but fire at twice the RPM.
    + This does not possess a coaxial stubber.


+ Demolisher Turret:
    + This ponderous beast's role is the delivery of large-caliber rounds to the target indirectly. As such, it fires the same munitions as our heavy mortar at a fairly low velocity.
    + Pressing F will toggle the round's muzzle velocity between 60 and 30m/s.
    + Shell types:
      + HE: 50 AT on direct hit, 25 on splash.
      + Siege: 70 AT on direct hit, 40 on splash.
      + Seismic: 50 AT on direct hit, 13 on splash. Stuns, slows, and deals partial damage to avatars through walls. Ask the OIC before you use this round type, as it tends to cause complaints.
      + Breach: 40 AT on direct hit, no splash. Forms a temporary breach hole wherever it lands.
    + With this turret in particular, due to the slower reload and low muzzle velocity, it is highly recommended to utilize the low velocity option and make good use of the minimap to indirectly bombard targets. With the right settings, shell impacts will show quite plainly on the minimap, making it easy to do with practice and talent.
    + This turret possesses a coaxial stubber.


+ Executioner Turret:
    + Equipped with the eponymous Executioner Plasma Cannon, this turret is essentially a straight upgrade from the battle cannon, and is priced accordingly.
    + Left-clicking will fire the cannon, and holding left click will increase the charge of the blast up to 2 times.
    + Each level of charge increases the size and AT of the resulting explosion, and carries with it an appropriate heat penalty.
    + At 100 heat, the turret will begin to self-damage the tank at double the rate the annihilator turret self-damages. At 200, the turret will shut down until heat falls below 100. R initiates a purge, which will more rapidly vent heat until fully cooled. Mind your heat levels, or fry in your own armor.
    + Charge levels:
      + 1: 10 heat, 10 direct AT, 8 splash AT
      + 2: 15 heat, 20 direct AT, 15 splash AT
      + 3: 30 heat, 80 direct AT, 32 splash AT
    + Pressing 1 will toggle rapid-fire mode, which will allow the user to hold left mouse to deliver small plasma blasts at a brisk rate of fire. These blasts build 4 heat, deal 5 direct AT, and 4 splash AT.
    + Pressing 2 will toggle heat safety, which will cause the turret to automatically vent at 100 heat.


#### Wyvern Suppression Tank
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Great for area denial.
+ Can move while shelling a marked location.

#### Controls:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ WASD to move
+ E to fire hull-mounted heavy bolter
+ Left click to fire main turret. Uses mortar mouselook firing
+ F to fire main turret at locked coords
+ R to reload
+ 2 to switch ammo types
  + Stormshard: Releases a high-volume payload of essentially oversized razorwire without a center of mass.
  + HE: It’s an HE mortar shell.
  + Shrapnel: Airbursts a bouncing shrapnel payload above the target.
  + Scatter: Exactly what it says on the tin, a shell that airbursts and scatters exploding submunitions below it.
+ 1 in alt-cam or mouselook to lock coords
+ C direct-fires the cannons without mortar mouselook targeting. Be warned, though: Much like the hydra, you cannot fire below your chassis horizon.

    Based closely on the Hydra design, the Wyvern exchanges the Hydra's anti-aircraft cannons for a pair of twin-linked Stormshard Mortars. The Mortars unleash a torrent of airbursting shrapnel shells which shred enemy infantry.

    The Wyvern is a burst-fire tank mortar of death. Use it to shell entrenched positions or lines of advancing forces, but otherwise treat it like a Hydra, except you can use it at high positions. Be mindful that if something is above you, hey guess what you're useless.


#### The Vulture Gunship
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Excellent for providing short-lived strafing/saturation fire on ground troops and vehicles.
+ LBA light ONLY, will die very quickly unless you are careful and skillful.
+ Has an accurate hitbox around the entirety of the vehicle. Be mindful where your wings are!
+ Requires a gunner to use the nose weapon.
+ Can roadkill infantry.

#### Controls:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ W to move forward
+ S to reverse
+ A to strafe left
+ D to strafe right
+ E to ascend
+ C to descend
+ Mouse1 to fire inner hardpoints
+ F to fire outer hardpoints
+ R to reload flares and hardpoints
+ 2 to fire flares
+ AS GUNNER:
    + Mouse1 to fire nose weapon. Note that you have a limited turret traverse much like the hull mounted weapons on our armored ground vehicles.

#### Current hardpoints:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Rocket Pods:
  + 19 rounds of mini-frag rockets. 38 total.
  + Deals 3 AT on direct hit to armor.


+ Hunter-Killer Missiles:
  + Ground vehicle-seeking rockets that deal 40 AT on direct hit to armor, 10 on a splash.

#### Current nose weapons:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Heavy bolter. Same as the one on the chimera, but with a different turret traverse limit.

Have them practice flying around the sim. Note that due to their fragility, it is good practice to not stay exposed for too long. Line up a strafing run or a target, ascend from cover, strike on the move whilst popping flares on the way, and descend behind cover. Holding E whilst pointing the nose of the craft diagonally downwards and flying forwards will prevent them from slamming into the ground while doing a strafing run. Note that it is best used in urban builds with tall buildings along relatively wide roads, or wherever else has decent air cover


#### The Valkyrie
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ 150 hp, LBA lite only
+ Holds up to 6 passengers, 2 door gunners, and the pilot
+ Multilas shreds pretty decently. Don’t rely on it in lag.
+ 32 mini frag rockets

#### Controls:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ WASD for Forward, strafe left, reverse, strafe right
+ E, C for ascend/descend
+ Mouse1 to fire multilas
+ F to fire rockets
+ 2 to fire flares
+ R to reload everything

Additional Valkyrie-related training:
+ fly it without killing yourself and you'll get an A+
+ I don't know have them fly people around and deploy them over certain points. use the markers for the deployment/gravchute training. I don't know ~~this plane sucks~~ we literally never use it.

Note from Sam: That's **your** problem. The plane is amazing but needs to have the lascannon gesture changed to something we can access again.


#### The Helltalon
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

Note from Sam: This is **not** to be used in an anti tank capacity until its munitions have been updated. **Do not** use the cluster munitions **at all**.

#### Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ ~ Rezzes Vehicle Sitbase
+ /1 reset -Forces a script restart.
+ /1 vel:## - Adjusts shell munitions muzzle velocity.

+ 8 bombs per salvo
+ Fire with Q
+ 8s Reload between bombs
+ Switch between bombs with 1


  + HE Bomb
    + 10m Radius, 15 AT High Explosive bomb.
    + This will deliver AT to scripted objects, ie Landmines.


  + Krak Bomb
    + 3m (Avatar), 10m (Object), 30 AT Krak bomb.
    + This will deliver AT to scripted objects, ie Tanks.


  + Cluster Bomb
    + Cluster munitions of ~6m per explosion.
    + No AT damage, Only avatar damage.


  + Blight Bomb
    + Gas bomb, Avatar damage only.


  + Inferno Bomb
    + Incendiary bomb, Avatar damage & Seated avatar AT,
    + Same as the Inferno grenade.

#### Combat Simulation
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Kill a 400hp tanks 5 times

#### Things to keep an eye on in the simulation
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Did the trainee maintain movement?
+ Did the trainee make use of proper munitions?


---
## S5, III. OPTIONAL - Advanced Movement Obstacle Course
---

+ While it's a way of further teaching about prim-jumping as legit movement, it is in no way testing superiority in SL movement. IT IS THE ULTIMATE TEST OF PATIENCE.

+ No time limit, no use of anything besides avatar movement controls. List of NO: No AV flying, no use of the HUD (Placing barricades, breaches etc), no sit hacking, no spacebarring.

+ Start home at green line, 2 checkpoints in Green Boxes halfway in to set home. For them to complete the course they must land on the red prim at the very end, and must have jumped through the course.

+ If they manage to get through this, tell an officer to toss 'em 2k corruption. It's a big pain in the dick so they earned it.

{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ E+C Engage Warp Drive
+ E Increase the Distance of the Warp
+ C Decrease the Distance of the Warp
+ W: Will Warp you in the Direction your mouse is facing at the distance you specified. TRY NOT TO WARP INTO SIM BORDERS!

### Pre-deployment commands
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ /1 hp: Choose between LBAL and LBA (LBA is default)
+ /1 rm: Toggle between global rezzing and local rezzing (Defaults at 50m)
+ /1 h:##: Sets deployment height
+ /1 tur or /1 turret: Choose type of turret (Las-Battery and missile pod) More info below

### Deployment
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Use your Rapid Deployment key that comes standard with other vehicles and accept the Permission Request when prompted.

### HUD
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Each Fleetship comes with its own HUD that will emerge when you have accepted the controls.
+ The HUD will handle things such as Munition selection for ground bombardment cannons and Modular turret selection.

### Combat Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Fleet ships will have multiple systems that can be fired independently and simultaneously with each other.
+ They're controlled after selection with your mouse, and basic gestures depending on the system, as well as the HUD.
+ For Iconoclast:
  + Use '1' to toggle through type of weapon system
  + Use '2' to toggle ammunition type if available.

### Iconoclast Weapon Modules
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Mouse 1 trigger
  + Bombardment cannon
    + High Explosive Shell (50AT)
    + Ignition Shell (25AT and ignites virusbomb gas from Naglfar)


+ Turret
  + Las-Battery (Raycast 15AT)
  + Missile pod (15AT LBA or 25AT Normal - Dumb Fire and locks on later if within vicinity)


+ Side Bolters
  + Manually aim and fire, or use "Space" to toggle interception field

Some Fleetships will have Torpedoes or Missile systems which will fire on the "f" gesture included in the basic gesture box.

These are designed for Massive damage during ship-to-ship engagements.

### Combat Box Formation
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ A Primer on the concept and history of combat box formations can be seen here:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_box

+ The Idea of a box Formation is to create a Three Dimensional Arrangement of ships in a box of overlapping fields of fire to minimize the need for a fighter escort.
+ It enables the Fleet to act with minimal fighter support and frees up the Fighters and Bombers to do their intended job instead of babysitting the fleet.
+ However Combat Boxes can also be established using multiple aircraft and a single Fleet ship.
+ Ideally we'd want to have several Escort class ships and a Cruiser or Capital Ship to Increase our dominance of the sky.

## S8, I. Marauder and Up Weapons
---

### Plasma Pistol
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Layer 2
+ Does not use ammo, instead generates 15 "heat" per shot
+ Overheating will teach the unwise lessons of pain.
  + Over 70 heat will deal 2% damage per tick to the wielder
  + Over 100 heat will **double** the current heat, initiate an immediate reload, and deal 5% damage per tick until heat returns to 0


+ Semi-automatic
+ 5 AT on direct hit, 3 AT and LL splash damage, and damage over time from plasma burst.


### Raptor Powersword
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Layer 2
+ Mostly a neat shiny thing that you can have in place of the chainsword.
+ Doesn’t do AT to deployables.
+ Delivers 5 AT to vehicles or other seated avatars.

### Discipline Baton
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Layer 2
+ A(n) ~~worthless~~ **amazing** melee weapon that doesn't collect skulls and does partial damage by default
+ Smack ~~people~~ **CULTISTS AREN'T PEOPLE** with it and get blackscreened when they get pissed at you.
+ 10/10

### Plasma Gun
{: .no_toc .text-delta }
+ Layer 1
+ A decent mid-range skillshot weapon
+ High AT output
+ Has heat in place of ammo; the more you shoot, the faster heat builds up
+ Upon overheating, it automatically vents heat and damages the wielder until fully cooled.
+ Can vent heat early by pressing R
+ Fires on mouse up instead of mouse down
  + Left click can be charged in order to deal more AT and have a wider AoE. Doing so generates more heat than normal.

## S8, III. Corruption Unlocks/Undivided Equipment
---

### Accatran Pattern Laspistol, Left-handed
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 500

### Heretic's Axe
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 500
+ Simply a 5m melee, but looks better than the heretic blade.

### Mk III Bolt Pistol, Left-handed
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 750

### Hand Flamer
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 750
+ Layer 2
+ The flamer, but smol.
+ Smol size means smol reload time and mag size.
+ Explain the situational use of using the Hand Flamer such as using it as area of denial.
+ Show them how to change the fuel pressure to release only gas over flames as well.
  + Same as the regular flamer (see gen poop veteran weapons above)


+ Have them practice learning to arc the weapon by firing it into the trenches properly.

### Combat Shotgun
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1000
+ Less range than the pump-action shotgun.
+ Press Q to change mags to a 20-round drum
+ Type /1 auto to change to full automatic fire.
+ Shell Types:
  + Buckshot
  + Bolt Slug
  + Inferno Blast

### Riot Shield
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1000
+ Hold C to deploy shield.
+ Shield repairs itself when not in use.
+ Shield repairs faster when destroyed, but is not usable until it returns to full HP.

### Mortis Pattern Autopistol, Left-handed
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1000
+ Mortis Flag Required (If a militia member asks for a mortis flag give it to them, it's nbd)
+ Layer 2
+ Double the fun means around twice the reload time
+ Ideal for grav chute deployment

### Flamer Fuel Tank
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1000
+ Turns the general-pool flamer into a sustained fire weapon.
+ Fuel recharges over time instead of reloading.
+ Does minor AT to EVERYTHING.

 Use it to burn out with indirect fire or defend a position by making paths to it unpassable. Let it charge to 100 ammo and burst fire and wave your cursor around whilst pointing in the air. Create impassable walls of fire. If the fighting is especially chaotic, go to full fuel pressure and do the same thing, except now even you don't know where the fire will go- it may even bounce back. Be responsible and don't spray fuel everywhere unless you intend to ignite it. Remember to also have a range option in case you're caught without fuel in the tank, because it can and will run out and you'll be sitting on your hands in a panic.

### Voss Pattern Autopistol, Left-handed
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1000
+ Layer 2
+ Double the fun means around twice the reload time

### Power Axe
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 2000
+ Layer 1
+ Deals 15 AT per swing
+ When used with an assault pack, the ground-pound maneuver will deal 20 AT and kill enemies in a lane in front of the user, similar to a claymore mine.

### Tech Pack
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 5000
+ Injects new buttons into the HUD, allowing us to deploy turrets and generators.
  + Generators have 250 health, and make a big boom when they die. They have enough power to run 3 turrets of any type that are placed within 50m or so. Generators can power turrets through walls.
  + Bolter Turrets are for anti-personnel purposes. They will attack unseated avatars within a certain range.
  + Missile Turrets are anti-air, and will fire flak missiles at any avatar that flies or jumps above a certain height, whether or not they’re seated.
  + Lascannon Turrets are anti-armor, and will deliver 10 AT per shot to seated avatars.


+ All turrets have: 100 HP, raycasted detection arcs that cover 180 degrees to the front of the turret’s current facing, and a 2 second warning klaxon before they open fire.

### Artillery Radio Pack
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1500
+ Injects new buttons into the HUD, allowing us to deploy heavy mortar pieces.
  + The Heavy Mortar fires the same shells (except breach shells) that the demolisher russ turret fires.
  + The Thudd Gun fires 8 HE shells per magazine. It is good for saturation, but fairly inaccurate.
+ Both artillery pieces can be either manually fired or synced to the spotter's binoculars and radio pack for remote aiming and operation.
+ Spacebar syncs the radio pack with the nearest heavy artillery piece within a few meters. After syncing, spacebar will fire the linked artillery piece from anywhere in the same sim.
+ Both artillery pieces can be moved, provided two avatars sit on them.
+ Both artillery pieces can be towed with the Russ. Simply back up to the piece and press space to attach the towing cable.

### Entrenchment Pack
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1000
+ Injects new buttons into the HUD, allowing us to deploy large walls and gun carriages.
+ Walls start at 200 LBA light, but can be over-repaired to turn into 400hp full LBA rockrete fuck-off walls.
+ Gun carriages are essentially 75hp sit barricades with pre-mounted heavy weapons, extended magazines for said weapons, a limited field of fire, and the ability to roll extremely slowly (and badly, do not take these over rough terrain).
+ Carriages may be over-repaired to entrench them, removing their ability to roll, but increasing their hp to 125.
+ Clicking and holding the carriage will attach a gun shield that increases a carriage's hp by 40, but cuts its field of fire in half. Extremely useful for holding long corridors.
+ Highly recommended as an early corruption purchase, especially for fellows inclined towards heavy support.

### Rigged Synaptic Disintegrator
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1000
+ Renegade Rank Required
+ Layer 1
+ A hybrid between the longlas and shotgun.
+ Within a short range, has a 50% damage max "flaying" effect on enemies in a cone around the main beam
+ 14 shots in the mag.
+ Recharges over time, but can also be manually reloaded.
+ Deals 5 AT per shot.

### Arc Rifle
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1000
+ Layer 1
+ 16 rounds in the mag
+ Press 1 to switch between full and semi-auto
+ Has haze, but the haze wounds, blinds, and slows instead of killing outright.

### Arc Pistol
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 600
+ Layer 2
+ As the arc rifle, but smol.

### Splinter Rifle
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 750
+ Layer 1
+ Very accurate, high RoF rifle that deals partial damage.
+ Rounds have a small splash AoE, and if they strike an avi will detonate shortly afterwards, dealing damage based on how many rounds hit.
+ 3 rounds to kill.

### Splinter Cannon
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 1000
+ Layer 1
+ As the splinter rifle, with less accuracy, added movement spread, and a larger magazine.
+ /1 autowalk will cycle between RLV settings, allowing you to automatically walk while firing, walk while zoomed, or turn autowalk off entirely. As you might surmise, walking slightly increases accuracy.

### Splinter Pistol
 {: .no_toc .text-delta }

 + Corruption: 350
 + Layer 2
 + As the splinter rifle, but burst-fire.
 + /1 burst will toggle a charged-shot mode, which builds more toxin levels in exchange for more ammo used per shot.
 + Left-hand version available.

### Jammer Array
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 400
+ Layer 3
+ As jammer array deployable, but in your hands.

### Graia Pattern Stub Rifle

+ Corruption: 250
+ Layer 1

### Stalker Bolt Rifle:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Layer 1
+ Semi-automatic bolter with 14 rounds
+ 1 and 2 to cycle round types
+ Round types:
  + HE: Slightly larger explosion than a standard bolter
  + Ignition: Less splash damage, lights people on fire for a time based on explosion proximity
  + Shrapnel: Fires a directed shrapnel cone on contact with a surface (or when fuse distance is reached). Shrapnel expands perpendicular from struck surface.
  + Acid: As other acid pools.
+ Pressing C while in mouselook locks in or clears a fuse distance. Rounds will then airburst once fuse distance is reached. Q and F decreases and increases the fuse distance respectively.
+ EXTREMELY USEFUL for clearing people off rooftops, especially if they are cheesing the structure of said rooftop.

### Escher Pattern Autocarbine
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 500
+ Layer 1
+ Slightly higher firerate than Agripinaa autogun, but less accurate.
+ Drum mag on /1 drum, extended mag wargear on /1 extend
+ Stock option with /1 stock. No stock is less accurate but has a faster winddown, stock has more accuracy but slower winddown.
+ Suppressor available with /1 supp. Reduces velocity to 150m/s.

### Agripinaa Pattern Autocarbine
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 400
+ Layer 1
+ As the Escher autocarbine, but with stock options as well as normal underslung equipment.
+ Does not have 100rnd extended mag or suppressor options.

### Havoc Launcher
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Corruption: 700
+ Layer 3
+ A multi-shot rocket launcher, the havoc launcher provides more direct-fire capabilities than the grenade launcher, and an (obviously) larger magazine than the Accatran rocket launcher, while sacrificing some payload yield.
+ 1 and 2 cycle back and forth between rocket types
+ F breech loads a shell
+ Has the same custom magazine programming and reload controls as the Accatran pump shotgun.
+ Shell Types:
  + Frag: Standard 5m explosion, does 5 AT on hit or splash.
  + Krak: Inert Krak dart, no explosion, 9 AT on hit.
  + Flash: Flashbang rocket, does not stun, 4 AT on hit.
  + Splitter: Chaff dummy munition, deals 4 AT on hit, then splits into 5 chaff clouds.

Congrats, dickhead, you're done. Thanks for sitting through and listening to or reading all of this.

No, really. You've done all the training. Get the fuck out of my office.
