## S1, I. Pre-Training

### READ THIS TO YOURSELF. THIS IS A LIST OF THINGS FOR YOU TO GO OVER AND CHECK OFF BEFORE THE TRAINING BEGINS.
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Read and understand all the documents before conducting your first training. You don't need to be able to remember it by heart, but understand how much you are asking the person to do and learn. Each section of training (aside from Section 1) takes anywhere from 1-2 hours depending on many factors. One of those factors is your own ability to understand and teach: waste time NOW so you do not waste time LATER.

+ STDs should begin 1-2 days after promotion to Renegade from Cult, but ideally right after promotion. If that is not possible, and they must wait, give them a crash course on how to throw a grenade, use their autogun, use the cleaver, laspistol, and rocket launcher. That will suffice until you can give detailed instructions. Consider this option if this is your first rodeo as a trainer and you haven't read this document in full yet.

+ You can still mess with them and call them dumb and shit, but the hazing is over. It is very important they are able to understand the information you give to them. Periodically ask if they have any questions as you complete sections. Once you start a new day of training, **check their information retention** by asking them what they learned the previous day. Do remedial training as needed.

### THINGS TO DO OR HAVE THEM DO BEFORE YOU START ANY TRAINING WITH THEM:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Make sure they are in the main Chaos Indivisvm group, and that they are removed from the Cult Group

+ Get them registered in the database (white box in armory, you or an officer double check that they are listed as a RENEGADE in the database.)

+ Get them access to the forums (clickable box in the spawn, talk to an officer to get them proper access and to make sure they have the right tags in the forums)

+ Make sure, if they aren't there already, that they are in the Discord. Ask someone to make sure they have the "Renegade" tag, and take away their "Cultist" tag.

+ Make sure that they get the following from the Armory, and make sure to clarify version numbers with people, especially with older gear, to avoid confusion or mixups:
    * Chaos Enlisted HUD
    * Command HUD
    * Chaos Basic Gestures, and activate all of them (including the ones in the HUD and equipment like the grav chute)
    * ALL Renegade general pool weapons, equipment, and vehicles (Marked by [R]).
    * you MAY want to wait until section 2 for this part as the weapons are explained in the order that they appear on the wall but it’s up to you.


+ To avoid getting black-screened, have them use [this preferences setup](http://i.imgur.com/Ui1l4uK.png)

+ As for preventing Teleport failed Alert spam (and viewer lockup):
    * They can ask any oldfag for the old notecard on how to fix it.
    * notifications.xml can be found in the firestorm directory under skins > default > xui > en
    * Make sure they back it up first!!!


+ Should a Renegade acquire a Corruption unlock for a weapon and seeks to learn to better use the weapon, or you recognize a lack of proficiency, proceed with optional Corruption training in Section 8.

## S1, II. Orientation

### READ OR PARAPHRASE THE FOLLOWING
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Today is your first day of actual training. From here on out, your training will actually teach you useful information and will be designed to familiarize yourself with our gear, assess your skills, and encourage you to get better with our gear. The hazing process is over, so you are encouraged to ask any and all questions, no matter how stupid they might initially sound in your head. We are going to be going over a lot of information over a rather short period of time; if at any point you need to leave, we can continue this training at any date with myself or any other trainer. We will be keeping track of your progress, so you will not have to repeat any of these steps.

+ Right now you are a Renegade: from here, your goal should be to become a Veteran, and we're all here to help you do that. If you want to eventually train people and lead raids as well, you might become a Marauder- but to get there, you must get this shit done first. To become a Veteran, you must:
    * Complete Sections 1-4 of your STD
    * Be active as a Renegade for at least 14 days.
    * Be recommended for promotion by at least two Marauders or higher.


+ That said, being a Renegade, the lowest actual rank, in our group is pretty great, but we want you to earn that Veteran rank. Renegades begin with a broad selection of gear. These pieces of gear are generally sorted into three schools of thought: generic, heavy support, and fast attack. For the first part of your training we will be focusing on the more generic tools you have access to, ones with straightforward applications you may find yourself using in every fight.

## S1, III. Basic Conduct as Renegade

### READ OR PARAPHRASE THE FOLLOWING]
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ DO NOT use unauthorized weaponry during combat.
    * Use the most up-to-date version of a vehicle or piece of equipment unless instructed otherwise by a Lord/Overlord or we'll sack you.
    * If you are confused about the terminology: If it isn't in the armory, given to you by Dread, or a Lord/Overlord hasn't approved of its use: IT ISN'T AUTHORIZED!


+ CALL OUT (or ask as appropriate) when you are using more advanced/specific weaponry (snipers, mortars, bolters, plasma, etc) so the officer-in-charge (OIC, whoever is the highest rank at the time leading, or assigned autonomously) knows how to conduct against the opposing forces- he needs to know what tools he has at his disposal and make adjustments as necessary.

+ Communication should be uncluttered, so keep it clear and convey only necessary information that your OIC needs to hear, like enemy positions and status. Do not be fucking annoying or disruptive during raids. If you hear "Clear Comms!", you shut the fuck up immediately. Do not make people say it twice.

### READ THIS SECTION TO YOURSELF
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Each new Renegade has a different level of competence. Go as fast or as slow as you think you need to, they need to know all of this. Make sure they can keep up. This applies to every Phase. Stop after a few minutes and check if they have questions or if they need you to repeat yourself. There will be checkpoints listed here for optional questions, but you can (and should) ask your own to test them and make sure they're understanding everything you're telling them. This isn't an assessment, these questions are to better teach and allow for them to retain the information.

## S2, I. The Basics

+ Basic Combat Functions
    * Left click to fire
    * Right click to zoom, control with mouse wheel
    * Minimap to identify approximate avatar positions, arrow up - above relative to you, arrow down - below relative to you


+ Mention basic gestures and commands used:
    * R: Reload
    * 1: Toggle between modes if gun has any
    * 2: Option 2 for toggle modes if available
    * F: Changes some firing modes OR deploys certain vehicular / deployable weapons.
    * /1 helpL1, /1 helpL2, /1 helpL3: shows gun instructions in chat for layers 1, 2, and 3 respectively.


+ Tell them about the gun sets and gestures (Shift + 1/2/3/4)
    * Set 1: two-handed weapons (Lasgun, autogun, etc.)
    * Set 2: one-handed weapons (autopistols, laspistols, cleaver, etc.)
    * Set 3: Auxiliary weapons (Rocket Launcher, grenade launcher, infantry mortar etc.)
    * Set 4: Slings all weapons
+ Let them know that it is good form to wear all layers at once.]

+ Show them how they can effectively switch between weapon types and examples
    * engaging between ground units and air units, switch between set 1/2 and 3 OR
    * engaging between infantry and vehicles, switch between set 1/2 and 3 OR
    * Set 1 weapon run out of ammo, quickly switch to set 2 or 3
    * Inform trainees that a weapon being reloaded will CANCEL its reload when you swap to another layer.
    * Inform trainees that upon death, all weapons equipped are automatically reloaded with no additional input required.


+ Target Leading
    * Show trainees how to lead targets (the crosshair is no longer effective for doing this). Remember that you do not shoot at where a target is, but instead where they are going to be.
    * Note: Each gun varies in spread and ammo count


+ Raycast:
    * RAYCAST IS CHEAT.
    * Raycast is similar to a sensor script in a way. Rather than being a radius around an object detecting avatars, it is an object that CASTS A BEAM, OR A RAY RATHER, that senses avatars that are in said beam. The beam detects the avatar and rezzes a kill prim on them.
    * All raycast are intersim, except for the laspistol.
    * Less target leading is required compared to normal guns, so readjust as necessary.
      + A good rule of thumb is to aim approximately one body length ahead of a target running laterally across your screen.
      + This is very dependent on client latency. Users are encouraged to practice until they find the 'sweet spot' appropriate for their needs.
    * Raycast performance is impacted severely by sim lag, so you may be required to switch to normal physical bullet guns. You will know if raycast is failing when the weapon reports a killing shot, but fails to kill the target.

## S2, II. Renegade Weapon/Equipment Types

### S2, II. P1. Layer 1 Weapons

+ Agripinaa III Autogun
    * Basic Chaos Rifle
    * SECONDARY ATTACHMENTS! : Hold 'C' and left mouse click to fire. Can fire bullets and reload after shooting, but attachments resume reload after stopping, not during.
    * Grenade launcher (/1 gl) - Fires an explosive round at a small arc.
    * Shotgun - Fires a burst of buckshot. Buckshot does partial damage. Also has explosive slug rounds available through /1 slug.
    * Bayonet (/1 bayo) - 5m melee with 'C'. Smaller arc than swords. Collects skulls. Skulls can be turned in for corruption (explained in Section 2, V.)
    * Alternate 60 round drum mag available (/1 mag).


+ Graia Pattern Autogun
    * As the Agripinaa Autogun, possessing the same attachments and commands.
    * Larger bullets
    * More accurate for the first few shots
    * Much slower firerate


+ Accatran Pattern Shotgun
    * A decent close-mid range weapon. Fires raycasted "pellets" in a cone pattern, and reloads each shot individually
    + Controls:
      + 1 and 2 to cycle shell types.
      + F to "breech load" a single shot of the selected shell type. This will be fired the next time you shoot.
      + Q to enter "loadout mode." In loadout mode you can either press R to load a full magazine of the selected shell type, or F to load a single shell.
      + If you load a single shell in loadout mode, you can select other shells and load them to make a custom magazine, OR you can press Q again to cancel loadout mode.
      + /1 load will open a dialog menu, as well as print out a list of shell types in local chat. You can use this menu to more conveniently create a custom magazine by entering a numeric code into the text box, then clicking submit. For instance, submitting 13131313 will create a magazine consisting of alternating buckshot and inferno shells.
      + /1 save1, /1 save2, and /1 save3 will save your current custom magazine to one of three save slots.
      + /1 load1, /1 load2, and /1 load3 will load saved custom magazines.
    + Shell Types:
      + Buckshot: Standard fare damage-dealing shells. 10 pellets, kills out to 30m and wounds out to 75m. Each pellet delivers 1 AT to LBA light.
      + Heavy Bolt Slug: Your only long-range option. Fires a physical explosive slug that kills within a 3m radius, and wounds within a 6m radius of the explosion. Deals 6 AT regardless of type.
      + Inferno Blast: A shorter-range option for both delivering AT and securing infantry kills. Fires 6 pellets that ignite on contact with air. Kills within 30m and wounds within 55m. Shells also have a chance to ignite avatars, dealing damage over time based on the damage they initially took. Pellets deal 3 AT to LBA light and 2 AT to full LBA.
      + Flak: Fires four physical flak flechettes that detonate when within 5m of an airborne target. This has a height check of 20m above the nearest surface for unseated avis and 5m above the nearest surface for vehicles. The flechette **will not detonate** on a target below these heights. Delivers 1 AT.
      + Acid: Fires four physical blobs of mutagenic acid that will bounce once before sticking and forming a pool. Acid deals 12% damage per half-second to avis, and 5 AT per half-second to scripted objects with an NPC flag. Any amount of AT from sources **other than shotgun shells** will clear a pool of acid. For the shotgun it takes at least 4 AT to a pool to clear it. This is so you don't accidentally clear your own pools as soon as you make them.
      + Sunspot Flash: A shell primarily designed to hinder and disable, rather than kill. When fired, anyone within 30m and looking at the shooter will be blinded. This effect extends with lesser effect out to 65m. The shell kills within 28m, but only wounds out to 30m. It deals no AT.
    * Each shot does damage based on where the target is in relation to your crosshair. It does more damage the closer a target is both in range and towards the center of your crosshair.
    * The damage falls off to 0 at 75m with regular buckshot regardless of how well the shot is lined up.
    * Semi-auto/pump action(kinda)
    * Take note of how the shotgun can be fired in the middle of a reload, because the shells are reloaded individually.


+ Kantrael Pattern Lasgun
    * Modes: Full, semi and auto.
    * Damage Falls off at Range. Does less damage the further away the person is.
    * Possesses the same attachments as the  autogun (except for the larger mag option) with the same commands for each.
    * Has heat haze like the longlas. The total "Kill footprint," or area that becomes dangerous when you fire, is a 0.25m thick plus-shaped beam, if anyone asks.
      * After a certain distance the haze wounds for 70% instead of killing. This is true of all las weaponry **except for** the lascannon.


+ Kantrael Pattern Longlas
    * Projects 5 raycast beams in a cross, more margin of error for aiming than the lasgun
    * Easier to hit target than Lasgun, smaller magazine and longer reload.
    * Bayonet (/1 bayo) -5m melee with 'C'. Collects Skulls. You know the drill.


+ Plaidgun
    * **Do not use the plaidgun without OIC permission. If you don't have an OIC and can't find an officer, don't use it.**
    * Don't do it. Period. We'll fucking fire you.
    * Very accurate raycast weapon with semi, burst, and full-auto firemodes.
    * No haze but fires in semiautomatic as fast as you can click.
    * Deals 4 AT to LBA Light.
    * Alternate explosive RC available by pressing Q. Deals 4 AT to full LBA, 6 AT to LBA light.


### S2, II. P2. Layer 2 Weapons

+ One-handed guns
    * Paired with one-handed melee on Layer 2


+ Voss Pattern Autopistol
    * High spread, high fire rate, small magazine. Like the autogun, no additional features.
    * One-handed


+ Graia Pattern Stub Pistol
    * Semi-auto physical bullet pistol.
    * Large bullets.
    * Wargear options:
      * Extended mag available with /1 mag.
      * Burst-fire available with /1 burst.
      * Suppressor available with /1 supp. Lowers bullet size speed, and visibility.


+ Kantrael Pattern Laspistol
    * One-handed
    * Damage Falls off at Range. Does less damage the further away the person is.
    * Has heat haze like the longlas


+ Repair Tool
    * Paired with one-handed gun.
    * Hold 'C' to trigger repair on sit bases/deployables while next to it. (5 HP per second)
    * Eyes collected have most value. 40 damage per tick over time.


+ Melee
    * Paired with one-handed guns on Layer 2
    * Trigger with 'C'


+ Agripinaa III Combat Knife
    * 2m range
    * Guts collected have more value.
    * Usable on any layer automatically with C, handy for layer 3 weapons with no melee option.


+ Heretic's Cleaver
    * Basic bitch 5m melee.


+ Spotter's Binoculars
    * 2m range melee on C
    * Holding C while alt-camming a location or in mouselook will target a synced heavy artillery piece to the sighted coordinates
    * Q syncs the binoculars to a heavy artillery piece within a few meters.


+ Orlock Omni-wrench
    * Hybrid melee/repair tool
    * 5m melee on C
    * Q switches between repair and melee mode
    * Repairs at a slower rate than normal repair tool


### S2, II. P3. Layer 3 Weapons

+ Rocket launcher
    * Modes:

        * Frag
            * Normal explosion, infantry, no drop off
            * Kills within 7.5m, partial damage out to 14m
            * Deals 10 AT on direct hit, 7 on splash

        * Krak
            * Krak explosion, mine, deployable, and vehicle killing rocket, very slight drop off
            * Deals 35 AT on direct hit, 25 on splash
            * AT radius is approximately 7m. Avi damage radius begins falling off at 4m and falls to 0 damage at 6m.

        * Flakk
            * Seeker rocket, mouse click for lock on beep, mouse over target (avatar) for lock on steady beep.
            * Pay attention to name of target listed in local chat. Reload (R) to clear lock on (Watch who you target!)
            * AT Damage is 25


+ Infantry Mortar

    * SEE S2, VIII. FOR IN-DEPTH TRAINING. DO NOT LET THEM USE UNTIL YOU HAVE COVERED THAT SECTION.

### S2, II. P4. Equipment

+ Grav Chute
    * Slow-fall with limited fuel, training in S2, VII.
    * Toggle activation with space bar
    * or use E to stop slow-fall, will resume when key is released.


+ Cult Bomb
    * Explain that renegades SHOULD retain their cult bomb. Detonate it and laugh at them. Tell them they can use their own detonation hotkey (explained in HUD) to detonate anyone at a lower rank than them that they are looking at.
    * Decent AT (50), very large explosion.


+ Assault Pack
    * ASSAULT PACK IS BEST THE END
    * Assault pack is best used to get around quickly and to avoid damage doing so.
    * Boosting forward/sideways, Boosting upwards and ground pound, Rushing (boosting forwards)
    * It does backblast so watch out who’s around you.
    * Explain the weapons that can be used with it when doing ground pound (Nurgle Scythe, Khorne Hammer, etc.)

## S2, III. Basic HUD Training

### READ THIS TO YOURSELF:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Like the weapon layers and the rest of this, the HUD is a lot. Slow down as needed and keep in mind how much information you are giving the Renegade. The bottom of this document contains a knowledge checkpoint. It is a very, very strongly recommendation that you utilize it.

### S2, III. P1. The Basics

#### PARAPHRASE / EXPLAIN THE INFORMATION BELOW!
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Go over the basic HUD gestures (Selecting and throwing grenades, deployables, etc.)
    * G [throw selected grenade]
    * Shift+G [switches grenade]
    * Shift+R [alt-grenade switch]
    * Numpad + [increase detonation delay]
    * Numpad - [decrease detonation delay]
    * T [deployment mode / deploy]
    * B [deploy / pick up]
    * X [deploy selected mine]
    * Shift+X [switches mine]
    * Z [detonate remote explosive, the one you are looking at]
    * Shift+Z [detonate ALL owned explosives]
    * V [warp gate / teleporter exit]
    * Shift+V [warp gate / teleporter entrance]
    * [ [rotate deployable counter clockwise]
    * ] [rotate deployable clockwise]
    * Ctrl+Space [switch between roll and sprint]


+ Explain that all selection of items in the HUD can be done via clicking on the HUD buttons.

### S2, III. P2. Grenades

+ Options to change grenade velocity (Left number) and time of detonation from THROW, NOT from impact (Right number).
    * You can control the detonation time delay with the NUMPAD + and - keys!
    * You can go into negative integers (the numbers turn red) with the timer to set the fuse delay to that number of seconds AFTER the first bounce.


+ Default Primary Grenades

    * Frag
        * Standard medium-long range explosive.
        * Deals 5 AT

    * Warp Frag
        * Larger explosion, damage falloff with distance, 10 AT, throws half the distance of frag.
        * Plasma cloud left behind burns people for partial damage for a very short time.

    * Blind
        * Blinds and deafens the target if they are caught in the area of effect and attempt to enter mouselook.
        * Intense slowdown/stun effect.
        * Both effects are concurrent and last 10 seconds.

    * Toxin
        * Produces a GREEN, slightly translucent gas cloud.
        * Area of denial, 25% partial damage every 2 seconds to avatars only.
        * If detonated in the air it falls downwards. (if it hits the top of a wall, for example, the gas will fall straight down to the ground)
        * Lasts for one minute.
        * With this, and other gas grenades, use in moderation unless told otherwise by the OIC. The Area of effect is quite large and lasts a while. A good rule of thumb for moderation is: If you see ANY ongoing gas effect, you may throw one more. If you see two, do not throw another until AT LEAST one expires.

    * Inferno
        * Area of denial
        * Partial Damage to avatars and seated armored targets such as barricades/sandbags, tanks, manned turrets, and sit barricades.
        * Also falls down if detonated in midair.
        * If it detonates against a wall or in the air, it makes MORE fire for airbursting "fun!"

    * Razorwire
        * Spits wooden stakes everywhere and then connects them to the point of detonation with razor wire.
        * If collided into, it does partial damage.
        * Use it to lock down areas, or throw it in the air and detonate it to see the wires disrupt jumping enemies.
        * Shoot wires or stakes to remove.
        * If airbursted, the center of the wire mass will slowly fall to the ground. Avatars in contact with falling wires receive massively increased damage.

    * Krak
        * 6m detection for scripted objects
        * Mine-clearing and 25 AT delivery
        * 3m detection for avatars
        * Can throw further than most other grenades
        * Good medium range anti-armor.

    * Melta Bomb
        * Will stick to objects you throw it at, or just land on the ground.
        * After a few seconds, it detonates for 70 AT to whatever it's stuck to and 50 splash in a HUGE explosion (back off)
        * The area it detonated in will be engulfed in pinkish fire that also does approximately 100 AT. It hurts a lot.
        * You cannot throw it very far, it's very "heavy".


+ Default Secondary Grenades
    * (Double click a grenade button OR shift+R to activate. Ordered here from left to right, top to bottom.)

    * Plasma Grenade
        * Has the same weight of a regular frag
        * Charges over time. At minimum charge, the effect is less than a regular frag. At max charge, the effect is similar to a warp frag.
        * Takes approximately 4 seconds to reach maximum potential.
        * Deals between 1 and 12 AT, depending on charge level.

    * Shrapnel Grenade
        * Fires deadly raycasted shrapnel in a spherical pattern from the center of the blast.
        * Shrapnel that collides with a wall can ricochet to hit targets that may otherwise be out-of-sight.
        * Excellent for scoring kills around corners, even untimed.

    * Illumination Flare
        * Blinds people that look directly at the flare.
        * Deals 20% damage on direct contact with the flare.
        * Marks both avatars and scripted objects with a bounding box that can be seen through walls.
        * Lasts for 20 seconds.
        * Use in conjunction with a suppression weapon or supporting squad is highly recommended.
        * In the absence of logistics, INTEL wins battles! Use these to SUPPLEMENT, but not replace good callouts.

    * Riot Gas Grenade
        * Produces a LIGHT BLUE, translucent gas cloud.
        * Anyone moving through the cloud will suffer a slowdown and blinding effect that gradually becomes worse.
        * After approximately 30 seconds of exposure, those exposed will start to choke, suffering 8% damage every 3 seconds.
        * After leaving the cloud, any currently suffered effects will linger for approximately 4 seconds.
        * Smoke clouds last for approximately one minute.

    * Fuel Cluster
        * Spews green puke (fuel) on the ground.
        * If ignited by almost any kind of fire (even from an assault pack taking off or plasma weapon), will act like inferno, AT and all.
        * Please don't spam, the sim will lag. If thrown into a fire, will also ignite.

    * Smoke
        * It's smoke
        * Useful to cover an advance or to blind a firing position.
        * Does no damage.

    * Chaff
        * Throw this at a DADs or other grenade interceptor
        * It will overwhelm them and allow you to actually shell a position whilst it is recharging.
        * If it intercepts it through a wall, it will destroy it because we don't like cheats.
        * Chaff will also DISABLE mines temporarily while it is active, making minefields safer to cross.

    * Melta Bomb Triggered
        * Same as melta bomb, except it detonates when you look towards it and hit 'Z'.
        * Or look away and hit 'Shift+Z'.
        * Deceptively useful to destroy something that is being actively repaired
            * OR if your goal is to deal a lot of damage at once by stacking bombs.

+ Unlisted Grenades
    * Use the SWAP GRENADE advanced menu button of the HUD to switch to these. Feature explained below.

    * Scatter
        * Splits into multiple grenades.
        * Pattern is very random, most effective air detonated.

    * Acid Grenade
        * Spews 4 puddles of bio-mutagenic acid on the ground.
        * ACID is distinguishable from FUEL by being BRIGHTER GREEN in colour, as well as emitting PARTICLES.
        * Acid deals 16% damage every 0.33 seconds to anyone walking over it.
        * Acid also deals 9 AT per second to scripted objects with the NPC flag.
        * Acid may be DESTROYED by dealing 3 AT, but not ignited.

    * Beach Ball
        * Throws a temporary bouncy beach ball.
        * Purely for fun.

    * Rock
        * Throws a rock.
        * Rock kills on contact until it bounces once.
        * Mainly for bragging rights.


+ God Favor Grenades (OPTIONAL)

    * Monowire Grenade
        * Khorne favour grenade, unlocked at 2 points of favour.
        * Deals damage in a 10m radius. Less damage than warp frag. Deals 10 AT.
        * Avis caught in the blast spawn a blood pool at their feet. If they die it spawns 3 pools instead.
        * Boiling blood deals 18% damage to avatars per tick and may be consumed by Khorne followers to activate weapon abilities.
        * Boiling blood has no effect on avis with 2 points of Khorne favour or higher.

    * Tzeentch Gravity
        * Pulls avatars and slow projectiles.
        * Works on sims without push AND the effects are raycasted
            * meaning they do not pull you through walls.
        * Detonates at the end of its lifetime, pushing objects and avatars away. Can be used to rocket jump with good timing.

    * Immolation Grenade
        * Second Tzeentch Favour grenade, unlocked at 3 Tzeentch favour.
        * Produces a medium-sized gas cloud, which may be detonated by any fire pools or explosions, or manually detonated with 'Z'.
        * Ignites anyone within the cloud at the time.

    * Slaanesh Torment
        * Flashbangs (with SCREAMING!) and traps avatars with daemonic chains.
        * Works on friendlies, but won't trap you.
        * Good for securing melee kills or stopping an advance.
        * Deals 10 avi damage if they move around while trapped.
        * Note that people walking into the radius while it is active will also be trapped.

    * Stimm Gas Grenade
        * Second Slaanesh favour grenade, unlocked at 3 points of favour.
        * Produces a DARK PINK cloud of stimulant gas.
        * Allies within the gas benefit from an shorter dodge cooldown.
        * After 2 seconds of exposure, anyone within the cloud will take 8% damage every 3 seconds due to blood toxicity.
        * There is a random chance that anyone affected by the stimulant will go BERSERK.
        * Berserk status causes the afflicted to lose control over their movement entirely, but gain a 60% damage automelee. Status ends after 1 minute.

    * Nurgle Infection
        * Infects avatars and spreads upon contact with other avatars. Upon spreading to another avatar, the stage or "gen" advances by 1. (Gens 1- 4)
        * The higher the Gen, the quicker it kills them.
        * Gen 3 turns them into a resurrectable zombie corpse
        * Gen 4 turns them into a fully-reanimated zombie on death.
        * If infected by your own infection, it will not kill you, but will do 3 damage per tick, meaning you won't heal over time
        * Will kill friendlies.
        * Zombies are hostile to everyone who is not Nurgle Favor 6 or higher (favor explained later in Section 2, V.)

### S2, III. P3. Deployables

+ Go over the different deployable defenses. Teach the trainee what all of the defenses do and benefits/cons of using them.

+ DEPLOYMENT works by tapping 'T'.
    * This is not the deployable, this is a representation of where it will be when spawned and this moves with your camera.
    * Tap the '[' and ']' square bracket keys to rotate the object in 45 degree increments.
    * Once you are satisfied, tap 'B' to deploy it!
    * You have unlimited deployables and a short cooldown.
    * Classic Deployment may be selected in the HUD if preferred. The HUD remembers which deployment mode you selected last. This persists across separate logins.


+ Barricade
    * blocks things, also good to prim jump over obstacles.
    * You can sit on it and it acts as a "sandbag"
    * Meaning you die when its HP hits 0.
    * It is good form to die on your deployable when under fire- but if you survive a firefight, you may stand up and make a new barricade or repair your existing one.
    * You MUST stand up to repair your barricade.
    * Barricade may be repaired beyond 50 HP, up to 150 HP, which increases the seating capacity to 3 people.


+ Barbwire
    * Slows down avatars and hurts them when they run at it
    * Doesn't hurt you if you walk.
    * Somewhat effective on top of teleporters and putting it behind obstacles just out of sight.


+ Wall
    * Provides quick access to taller cover than the barricade.
    * May be repaired beyond 100 HP, up to 200 HP.


+ Tank trap
    * Blocks things like the barricade.
    * When a tank(or other armored vehicle) hits the spike on the front at speed, it will deal AT damage in proportion to how fast it was impacted.


+ DADS (Dominus Area Denial System or Dominus Assisted Defense System)
    * Catches and detonates enemy grenades/rockets within radius.
    * Goes dim when the interception field is on cooldown.
    * Most groups will use high volumes of scatter grenades or shrapnel to shut it down.
    * SPACE THEM OUT!
    * Ensure 15-20M between them, put them at high and low elevations relative to you.
    * RAYCASTED - They do NOT work behind walls.


+ Harpoon Ladder
    * Deploys a ladder that anchors itself to an object up to 50m from the turret.
    * To use, press T to rez the turret ghost, then press B to finalize deployment while looking at the desired ladder destination.
    * In classic deployment mode, you will have to press B to adjust the turret after deployment, then B again while looking at the desired turret destination.
    * To fire the turret, either click on it whilst within 2 metres, or look at it and press Z.
    * Anyone caught in the path of a deploying ladder will be killed.
    * The HP of the ladder scales according to how long it is. Longer = lower HP.
    * A ladder that has been destroyed can be quickly redeployed by simply firing the turret again, assuming said turret is intact.


+ Conversion Field Projector
    * Deploys a small turret that, when adjusted with B, projects a bomb umbrella.
    * Bomb umbrella angle can be adjusted up to 45 degrees from zero in any direction.
    * The umbrella cannot be damaged (they must destroy the projector itself).
    * The umbrella damages avis on contact.


+ Deployed Jammer Array
    * Deploys a small turret that, when adjusted with B, constantly projects jammer waves.
    * These waves act to deal partial damage to avis and set off enemy AMS deployables.
    * Very annoying to the enemy. Use responsibly.

### S2, III. P4. Mines/Deployable Munitions

+ Strategy
    * Teach them how and where to strategically place mines
        * ie. around corners, stairways, doorways, objectives.

    * Teach them how to place them on surfaces by looking at them and being close, or looking up with your camera to throw them.
    * Also, yes, this means you can jump towards a ceiling and throw mines onto ceilings.
        * Especially important for razor wire and breaching charges.

    * Explain that most non-triggered deployables will detonate if you walk right on top of them.
        * Or don't.

    * Tell them that mine buttons can be reprogrammed in the same fashion as grenade buttons.


+ AP Mine
    * Anti-Infantry
    * 5m detection and explosion on enemies
    * Deals 5 AT


+ AT Mine
    * Double click AP mine
    * more damage to armored targets.
    * Still will detonate on infantry.
    * Deals 45 AT on direct hit, 30 on splash.
    * THEY RAYCAST UP TO DETECT VEHICLES ABOVE THEM!!!!


+ Motion Claymore Mine
    * Has more range than an AP mine, but this is in a single direction.
    * Use this when you know what direction someone will come from or around corners.
    * Be wary that it is likely to also detonate other claymores if they are clustered.
    * Deals 5 AT


+ Triggered Claymore Mine
    * Double click Motion Claymore Mine
    * same as Motion Claymore, except it is triggered with Z (by looking at it) or Shift+Z.
    * Deals 5 AT


+ Demolition Charge
    * A powerful, triggered explosive.
    * Good against vehicles or deployables, or toss them onto friendlies and let them suicide bomb themselves.
    * Also a decent offensive weapon if you learn the timing of when to detonate it after throwing.
    * Good for situations the triggered melta bomb is good for, but less AT and no AO fire
    * 25 AT splash, 50 AT to whatever it’s stuck to. Mutually-exclusive (will not do splash to stuck objects)


+ Breaching Charge
    * The breaching charge is like a demolition charge, except it deploys a permanent breach through a wall, ceiling, or floor.
    * Start by placing the charge and waiting for the chat message or audio cue that the charge is ready.
        * Press Z or Shift+Z and wait for the charge to spark.
        * If it is NOT disrupted (by shooting at it or w/e) it should detonate and have a HOLE!
        * This hole can be used by ANYONE, including enemies, permanently, until it is repaired.
        * Only your repair, the tech-axe, clean up buttons, and enemy negative-LBA damage / repair systems can remove it.
        * Be careful- crafty enemies will overwhelm your position and exploit these holes.
    * They can make us incredibly speedy when defending a position, but they can easily be our undoing.
    * If the charge detonates suddenly without a windup, then the wall is too thick to breach: use another section of wall that is thinner!
    * Beware the detonation, it will kill you if you are too close when the wall blows. It also kills people on the other side.
    * Deals 50 damage on splash, 50 damage to whatever it’s stuck to. Not mutually-exclusive.


+ Razorwire Charge
    * Like the grenade, It can only be triggered with Z or Shift+Z, or by shooting it.
    * Not a mine.


+ AA Mine
    * Double click razor wire charge.
    * When an avatar is over a certain distance over ground or floors, detonates flak in the sky.
    * Also detonates when walked on.
    * Flak can rain back down and hurt.
    * Good against jetpacks and some vehicles.
    * Deals 15 AT


+ Scrap spikes
    * Can be destroyed by any AT or physical collision.
    * Simply kills on contact.
    * Really big and obvious for what they do. Tease the enemy mercilessly if they run into them.


+ Bear Trap
    * Can be destroyed by any AT or physical collision.
    * Deals 70% avi damage on contact and immobilizes.
    * Deals 10% damage per tick if they try to struggle whilst trapped.
    * Anyone within 2m can click and hold the bear trap to disarm it.
    * If a trapped avi is killed, the trap will reset automatically.
    * If an avi's upper torso or head is in contact with the trap, they'll be flashbanged.


+ Flash Mine
    * Does exactly what you'd expect.
    * Smallest mine we have.


+ Shredder Charge
    * Like the shrapnel grenade, but in manually-detonatable charge form.


### S2, III. P5. Warp Gates
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Strategy
    * Make a habit of creating backup exit gates, even if we're at our 2-3 Gate limit rule or even if the attackers aren't using teleporters on a defense.
    * There is no downside to having a gate out. Just pay attention to your HUD indicator
    * If there is no blue mark, it means your gate died.


+ ALWAYS CALL OUT YOUR GATES
    * Tell us where they are, and where they lead (Map direction, specific buildings, etc.)


+ Left (Orange) - Entry.
    * Place with 'Shift+V'.
    * To enter, click on the red part of it.
    * If it doesn't work, turn on transparencies and look for the sphere.


+ Right (Blue) - Exit
    * Place with ‘V’
    * Must be oriented correctly upon placement
        * DO NOT face a wall when rezzing it.
    * You cannot go back through an exit.

### S2, III. P6. Extra HUD Features

+ Comm system
    * /1 c:[message] for everyone within the sim with the HUD to read
    * DO NOT clutter comms, only use for relevant information during combat

+ Blood safety
    * By typing /1 blood , users can render any blood puddles produced by their weapons or grenades safe to walk on by anyone. This is useful in sims where semi-permanent damage pools are forbidden.


+ Cleanup
    * /1 cleanup OR advanced HUD menu > clean up.
    * Use it after every raid/defense. Even if no one tells you to.
    * Use it if you accidentally gas/infect our spawn.
    * There are several cleanup commands through the advanced HUD menu accessible by hold-clicking the chaos star button until it beeps, then releasing.
    * Clicking the chaos star briefly will remove MOST lingering effects. This is useful as a quick "oh shit" button in the case of firebombing the spawn or something. This will not remove your mines or deployables.


+ Ammo Counter
    * Displays available ammo for attached weapons
        * (Plasma/melta weapons - displays heat percentage before overheat 100%.
        * Most useful with heat-based weapons.
    * When the sim is not laggy, use this to determine when it is "safe" to switch weapons


+ Maneuver HUD
    * 10m Dodge Roll and 3 second sprint
    * Bar converts to indicate vehicle hp and pack fuel (grav chute, assault pack) when gear/vehicle is attached/rezzed.
    * You should always have the maneuver HUD on!!!


+ Grapple Hook
    * Combination of the maneuver HUD and the grenade.
    * Toggle by tapping '4'.
        * Until you tap '4' again, you cannot use grenades. Instead, whenever you use your grenade hotkey, you will throw the grapple.
    * The grapple 'latches' onto whatever it impacts and is within line of sight
        * Meaning you can throw it over walls to scale walls.
    * You can throw the grapple hook AGAIN while grappling by using the grenade hotkey
        * You will fall until it grapples again.
    * Ascend by holding 'E'. Descend by holding 'C'.
        * If you descend too rapidly, the grapple will be cut and you will fall.
        * When you ascend to the grapple, you will go 'up and over' a little bit of where the grapple is.
        * Usually this results on you going up a ledge, meaning hitting a ledge EXACTLY is not required.
    * You can cut the line by pressing E and C at the same time, or simply press 4 to stow it entirely.
    * You cannot strafe with 'A' and 'D'.
        * You can however move in any direction you turn your camera tapping 'W'.
        * This movement maintains your momentum and can increase it.
        * Holding it and turning around an object with accelerate you rapidly.
        * Swinging back and forth and shifting camera position gets larger swings.
    * 'S' allows you to "bounce" off of a surface
        * It's a little faster than manually swinging with 'W' and looks somewhat more realistic.


+ Advanced HUD Menu
    * Accessed by hold-clicking the chaos star in the top left. From here, you can access:
    * Manual Stats command
    * Manual HUD reset command
    * Manual cleanup command
    * Manual AoE cleanup command
    * Manual Tech Deployable Cleanup command
    * Manual Lookup command (use UUIDs to see your friend's stats!)
    * Manual Corruption Transfer command
    * Toggle between new/classic deployment system.
    * Let them know to use classic deployment for high-lag situations.
    * Set Groups: Use this to manually add group UUIDs to HUD protection. Avatars with that group active will no longer trigger your mines or interception systems, and will be able to use your warpgates, gun carriages, and sit barricades until you sign out of SL. This is used when we're fighting alongside another group that is not using our militia tag/gear.
    * Swap Grenades: To use, press the button, choose whether you want to swap a main or alternate grenade, then press the number associated with the grenade button you wish to swap. 1-4 for the top row, 5-8 for the bottom row. The HUD will then list every grenade along with an associated number, and present a dialog box. Enter the desired grenade's number into the dialog box and press 'submit'. Grenade swaps persist across logins, so feel free to have your favorite grenades more conveniently accessible!


### S2, III. P7. Knowledge Checkpoint

+ Check the renegade's understanding of the current material. If they get it wrong, explain why they got it wrong and make sure they understand.

+ Invent your own questions / challenges, or use these. MAKE THEM SHORT, NO MORE THAN 5-10 MINUTES ON THIS SECTION!:

+ Have the renegade take off all of their guns. Ask them to create a full loadout (primary weapon, secondary/melee, auxiliary) without your assistance.

+ Deploy a barricade.
    * Ask the renegade to kill it as quickly as possible using what you have given them so far.
    * Any method is correct but make sure they they know how to:
        * Kill it by shooting it (with anything that’ll work)
        * Kill it by using the appropriate grenades
        * Switch weapons to continue doing damage


+ Ask them to advance across the sim and deploy their warp gate in locations that provide cover for the exit.
    * Time it. Shoot at them to mess with their progress and destroy their gate
        * ONLY if the location is a shitty one.

    * Optionally, get them a battle buddy to give them a backup gate
        * Mave them make the calls to tell their buddy to deploy their backup and keep advancing.


+ If making your own challenges, (( RECOMMENDED!!! )) tailor them to what you've noticed the Renegade struggling with, with things they seemed to dismiss, newer features for returning members, things you've struggled with in the past, or things with our normal loadout that are "need to know" that you know other groups don't have.]

+ DO NOT continue to Phase IV until you are sure they fully understand how to use all of the Phase 1-3 weapons/equipment AND can accurately demonstrate how to use the ENTIRE HUD

## S2, IV. Command HUD Training

+ Strategy & Basics
    * **YOU MUST WEAR THIS DURING COMBAT AND CAN UTILIZE PINGS EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT AN OFFICER OR COMMAND STAFF**
    * Do NOT move the command HUD! Moving it will break it
    * When pinging, COMMUNICATE the reason for Pinging location, or state beforehand.
    * DO NOT spam ping
    * Pay attention to relevant objectives and pings.
    * Switch it OFF by clicking anywhere on the HUD that doesn't have a button.
        * **Only do this if ordered to by the OIC.** OICs will **only** issue such an order if the fight is extremely laggy.


+ Commands
    * /1 OIC - If there is no current OIC, or you are a higher rank than said OIC, this assigns you as OIC.
    * /1 ping - Pings a coordinate (Yellow Box), Using a raycast to a location (Gesture 'Y')
      + Pings now show their coordinates in local chat as a link to anyone wearing a command HUD.
      + Click the link or the ping box itself if you are using a mortar (either infantry or the Wyvern) to auto-target your mortar to those coordinates.
      + Click the "eye" icon next to the coordinates while your camera is in its default position to zoom the camera to those coordinates.
    * /1 ping:<x,y,z> - Pings a coordinate, Using an input coordinate
    * /1 ba/bb/bc/bd - (OIC ONLY COMMAND) Sets a waypoint location, using a raycast to a location
    * /1 ba:<x,y,z>/ etc.. - Sets a waypoint location, using an input coordinate
    * /1 clear - If you are the OIC, Clears all set waypoints. If you are not, clears only your waypoints.
    * /1 oickey:<key> - Lord+ Only command - Assigns OIC to this key
    * /1 clear - Lord+ Only command - Clears the OIC


+ Buttons
    * 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
    * Sets waypoint location, for points A, B, C and D (OIC ONLY)


+ Half star buttons UNDERNEATH 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
    * Opens a textbox for inputting coordinates (OIC ONLY)


+ Upper Right star button
    * If you are the OIC, Clears all set waypoints.
    * If you are not, clears only your waypoints.

## S2, V. Corruption, God Favor, & Wargear

+ Corruption points grant weapon/equipment/ability unlocks by pledging Renegades to specific god(s).

+ Earning Corruption
    * Participation in raids/defenses (with an OIC,)
    * Tasks given by Command Staff
    * MELEE KILLS (Skull collection system).
        * All melee weapons have the ability to collect skulls to be converted to corruption.
        * Some that are more difficult to utilize grant even MORE corruption per kill!
        * /1skulls command with most melee weapons will display who you have killed and how many times.


+ Corruption Altar
    * How to Deposit Skull
    * How to pledge in dark pact for God Favor
    * How to transfer corruption (see if they're dumb enough to give you their corruption)
    * Show them some of the more "strange" weapons that can take skulls
        * autogun bayonet, repair tool, etc.


+ God Favor
    * Explain to them how God Favor works, and explain that they can spend corruption to buy god favor points.
    * You can only have so many points towards each god before points from rival gods will start being reduced.
    * You can only have up to two points of devotion toward each god without losing points from any other gods. Once you buy that third point for a god, you lose a point for that god's rival.
    * EXAMPLE: If you currently have two points of favor for each god but then buy a point of devotion toward Nurgle: Your new total will be 3 points to Nurgle, 2 points stay the same for Khorne and Slanesh, but you lose a point from Tzeentch as Nurgle and Tzeentch are rivals.
    * Once you hit your 4th point you are considered devoted to that god. Each time you buy favor to your devoted god after the 4th point, you will lose one point towards ALL the other gods. (when you buy the 4th point, all other points spent for your other gods go down by one, and this will continue for every point you buy for your devoted god going forward)
    * The altar will always alert you if the purchase you're about to make will result in lost points from another god so don't worry about going TOO in depth with this.


+ Wargear
    * Certain weapons may have access to additional attachments, firing modes, or munition types available for purchase through the wargear system.
    * By clicking on a weapon, gear, or vehicle box, users may see a button in the menu labeled "Wargear". Clicking this button will lead to another menu with available wargear for purchase with corruption. The prices for said gear will be printed out in local chat.
    * Users can purchase said wargear by clicking on the appropriate button, and having enough corruption in their account, at which point they will need to detach the related weapon or vehicle (if currently attached) and reattach it in order for the script to reinitialize.


+ OPTIONAL
    * Show them current deity-specific weapons (if you have access) available for them to decide later.

+ All corruption unlocks and their uses are listed in detail in section 8

## S2, VI. Skirmish/Combat Efficiency

+ HIGHLIGHT THE USE OF MINIMAPS to determine enemy positions.
    * Teach them about marking targets and using contact sets (if using Firestorm)


+ Pick ONE of these to do:


+ Grenades Only Duel
    * All grenades are allowed for this.
    * Go to about 10-20 kills in close quarters.
    * Assess their performance.
    * OPTIONAL:
        * Ask them to switch to a specific grenade mid-match or have multiple skirmishes using specific grenades.


+ Observed Duel
    * They may use any weapons you have gone over so far.
    * Make sure both use different group tags
        * for skull collection. This is allowed if two people are actively fighting.
    * Correct their flaws the best you can and give them tips on the areas they fail hard in.
    * Emphasize the importance of deployables before, during, and after the fight, warp gates and DADS in particular.
    * BE CREATIVE.
        * You may set up specific objectives for them to accomplish
        * capture points, warp gates, etc.
        * Failing that, first to 10 kills.
    * Tell them to HIT THEIR CLEAN UP BUTTON when done fighting.
    * Have them use the Corruption Altar to deposit any skulls when they’re done.


+ Defensive/Offensive Drill (Optional)
    * Tell the trainee to pick a building in the sim.
    * Give them 2 minutes of unmolested time to fortify their location as much as possible, including warpgates.
    * They must stay within this general area, but can continue to fortify during combat.
    * After 2 minutes pass, attempt to dislodge them. Time the fight. If you cannot dislodge them, destroying their gate and either destroying or co-opting 90% of their deployables in 15 minutes, they did a good job.
    * Reverse this process and have them attempt to dislodge you. If they do so within half an hour (You should be better at this than they are), they did a good job.


## S2, VII. Grav Chute Training

+ Reminders
    * This is a parachute, not a jetpack.
    * It will only slow your fall, not help you hover mid-air.
    * With limited fuel and falling from extreme heights, conservation of grav chute fuel is necessary to prevent hard-falling (and thus your death from opportunistic shots while animation-locked), or simply to avoid fire while free-falling.
    * If you are not using a backpack slot for something else, you should have this on.


+ Grav Chute Course
    * Located above VR.
    * The goal is to get to the bottom of the pit without dying and only falling straight down WITHOUT the grapple or other means other than the grav chute.
    * If the course is unavailable, fly up very high in the valkyrie and do not stop practicing with the grav-chute until the Renegade can stop hard falling

## S2, VIII. Infantry Mortar - All Eyes On Ground

+ Strategy/Etiquette
    * Always ask to be on a mortar.
        * It is not a force multiplier in every situation.
        * One person on a mortar means one less person is taking objectives or fighting
    * Never fire and forget. Note this does NOT mean to get tunnel-visioned on your target, but instead simply pay attention to things you destroy, and call into comms when its something important like a teleporter.
    * ALWAYS pay attention to comm callouts for specific objectives to be taken down by mortar
        * Teleporters, deployables, etc.
        * Do not tunnel-vision to a single target.
        * When in doubt, switch to HE and shell away from friendlies
    * Alt cam around the map and be sure to report enemy movement
    * KEEP AN EAR OUT FOR TELEPORTERS, TANKS, POSITIONS, ETC
    * Mortar munition moves by trajectory
        * Check for various obstacles between your position and target.
        * Find reasonable cover when deploying.
    * Remember that when you're on a mortar, you're everyone's bitch.
        * Fire exactly where you're told to fire, even if some asshole is asking for it unless they're contradicted by a higher ranking asshole.
        * You have eyes everywhere, but seeing the whole battle at once doesn't make you omnipresent.
    * Alternatively, if someone is nice enough to give you a specific coordinate position and asks for you to fire there, do so.


+ Basic Commands
    * Press ‘C’ to deploy.
        * While deployed, you will not be able to move.
        * Note that there is a cooldown before you can get back up, so plan ahead.
    * Use by alt-camming around the sim; in order to watch enemies and acquire targets.
        * Don’t get tunnel vision, there is no reason to sit there and watch what you are shelling
        * Pay attention to where your shots land and where they could be more useful
        * You can also fire while deployed and in mouselook.
        * This will use the low trajectory by default
        * Useful as an alternative to the rocket launcher.
    * When there is something to shoot, tap '1' to lock onto a coordinate that you are alt cammed on.
    * Tap 'F' or 'E' to fire (E is more responsive) to fire.
        * Remember your shell takes time to get to its location and can be intercepted.
        * Keep an eye on the location.
        * Shelling extremely mobile targets is a waste of time unless you're laying down razorwire or fire at a chokepoint.
    * Type in ‘/1target’ and input specific coordinates (<XXX,YYY,ZZZ>)
        * Note that you can copy/paste pings directly from local and it will work.
        * You can also click a ping link in local and the mortar will auto-target those coordinates. This is **very important** to learn.


+ Rounds & Firing Modes
    * Mortar has two firing modes.
        * /1high - rain from the sky.
        * /1low - If you are at an elevated position, such as a tower.
            * Faster and more direct firing
            * Be wary of enemy cover. Again, this is the default mode for mouselook.
        * The alt-cam firing method attempts to have the trajectory peak at the target position +10m.
        Pressing "Q" will open a dialog box where you can enter a number to choose a different trajectory peak. Leave it blank to return to the default trajectory.
    * Each round is almost exactly like a type of grenade, but more powerful in some cases.
        * Hit '2' to change rounds.


+ Available rounds are:
    * Frag
        * Blast radius similar to a frag rocket rather than a frag grenade.
        * Delivers 20 AT on a direct hit

    * Krak
        * Delivers 20 AT on direct hit (this is true of every mortar round save the flare)
        * plus 20 AT to every scripted object within the blast radius, including what it hit.

    * Chaff
        * Same as the chaff grenade.

    * Flash
        * Same as the flash grenade.

    * Smoke
        * As the grenade.


+ Wargear rounds:
    * Inferno
        * Airburst inferno round

    * Airburst
        * Airburst scatter round. Essentially a cluster round.

    * Razorwire
        * Airburst razorwire round. Significantly more wires than the grenade form.

    * Acid
        * Airburst acid round. Significantly more pools than grenade form.

    * Toxin
        * As the grenade.

    * Illumination flare
        * As the grenade form.




+ COOL TRICKS
    * Like Inferno grenades, inferno or razorwire rounds from a mortar ruin the fun of teleporters and chokepoints. Plant one of these rounds where the roaches are coming from and watch a forward advance stop in its tracks. When the area is clear of infantry, feel free to krak shell it to oblivion.
    * Radical artillery men quickly alt cam between two teleport points and shell both of them as quickly as possible.
    * Dropping infernos from the sky on barricades/sandbags is hilarious.
    * Ideally, you want to just barely clear any intervening obstacles with your shells in order to ensure the fastest speed whilst maintaining accuracy.
    * It is the wise artilleryman who opens a salvo with either an inferno, airburst, or chaff round to overwhelm enemy interceptors. Do not allow the enemy to blue-ball you, and remember that every second counts.
