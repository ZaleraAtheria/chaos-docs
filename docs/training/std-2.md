# Prologue: Veteran Training Requirements

After the first two parts of renegade training (Sections 1-2) have been completed, please continue on with Imperfectus Vehicle Training (Section 3) which can be found below.

Once the first three sections are completed ENTIRETY, Renegades must complete Advanced Renegade Training (section 4)

Consideration for promotion to VETERAN includes:
+ completion of training sections 1-4
+ 14 days participation after attaining the rank of Renegade.
+ recommendation of 2 members at rank Marauder or above.

After promotion to Veteran, they must complete advanced Veteran training FIRST (Sections 6 and 7) in order to be considered for Marauder.

I. Vehicle Etiquette

II. Tank Training - The Chimera

III. Plane Training - The Avenger

Explain that the next section will be dedicated to training with all of the vehicles accessible to all Renegade group members. (The Chimera & The Avenger) Make sure the Renegade has a functional “~” key that will deploy their vehicle or that they rebind the gesture if they do not.

All Training to be done on ground level of sim. This is so they get used to how the vehicles behave and get some practice on not flipping over and taking cover. Always double check to make sure their vehicles are up to date!]

## S3, I. Vehicle Etiquette

+ Deploy armored vehicles ONLY when instructed to by the OIC
  + We don’t just jump into tanks and planes because we feel like it or if we’re bored with the raid


+ Take the initiative and VOLUNTEER to deploy vehicles when there is a need for one!
 + The worst an OIC will do is say "No."
 + OICs will often issue corruption incentives to people who are the first to volunteer when a vehicle is called for, but this is not guaranteed.


+ If you are out in/on a vehicle and you are told to get off you GET THE FUCK OFF AND YOU GET THE FUCK OFF NOW.
  + Do it now, ask questions AFTER the raid. Period.
  + Often this means we have agreed to de-escalate with the enemy OIC. If you make your OIC out to be a fool or a liar by arguing or showing your ass, you will be dealt with according to the manner in which you have chosen to act.


+ RLV recommended. Quickly deploys vehicles. [Explain how to set up RLV and instruct Renegade to relog.]

## S3, II. Tank Training - The Chimera

### The Chimera is a big dumb tank for big dumb bois.
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Each tank has a “hull” and a “turret” section. All tanks in the group will be deployed using one turret and one hull.
+ Upon first attach, a menu will be displayed with several options, and some help text will print out in local chat. From here, you can access various settings. This menu is also accessible with /1 menu in local.

### Modes & Basic Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ HP selection (also through /1 hp)


+ LBA 150, 175, and 200hp
  + Full LBA mode, damage only from LBA weapons.
  + Like deployables, damage is near-instant.


+ LBAD 150, 175, and 200hp
  + As LBA, however, LBAD takes reduced damage on strikes to the front, and increased damage on strikes to the rear and bottom.


+ Always check with the OIC to determine what HP values they want vehicles set to.


+ Movelock: Type /1 movelock in local to engage this feature. This will freeze the sitbase of the vehicle, and cause the hitbox to become a static object while you are not moving. This is moderately useful to prevent unwanted movement, as so many scripters are still incompetent when it comes to making munitions that do not grief vehicles around.


+ Auto-flip: If you happen to find yourself flipped over, simply wait a few moments and the vehicle will right itself. Alternatively, you can press A+D to manually trigger this function.


### Rezzing the Sitbase
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Rez sitbase with /1 rez ('~' with Chaos gesture), or through the pop-up menu on first attach, or accessed with /1 menu
+ /1 hp to set HP and know which one to choose appropriately
 + Match up to enemy tank's HP, or as instructed by OIC.
   + 200 is usually fine though.

### Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ W: Forward
+ S: Backwards
+ A: Turn left
+ D: Turn right
+ Mouse1: Fire turret
+ E: Fire hull mount

### Hull mounts (/1 wep)
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Hull mounts can only fire in a limited angle in front of the vehicle, but are unconstrained vertically.

+ When you select a hull mount, or if you deploy with the default hull mount, you will receive a request to temp attach that weapon. You must accept the request for that weapon to be usable.

+ You may fire the turret and a hull mount at the same time. A hull mount will continue firing even if your camera rotates past its arc limit, allowing you to lay down 2 lanes of fire in radically different directions.

+ The currently available hull mounts are:
 + Heavy bolter: Exactly what it says on the tin. Performs like an infantry-carried, constantly-deployed heavy bolter with infinite ammo.

 + Heavy Flamer: Like a flamethrower that shoots further. Deals 1 LBA per shot, fire pools deal 1 LBA per second. The weapon of choice for armor engagements or close-range suppression.

 + Lascannon: As the infantry-carried lascannon, deals 25 AT per shot. Poor at infantry suppression.

### Deployment
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Passenger Sit prim on the back of the tank.
+ When deploying passengers:
  + COMMUNICATE to your passengers that you are deploying them or that they are to deploy on your mark.
   + You are the driver, it's your call


+ Make sure area is clear of hostiles so passengers may deploy safely to objectives.
 + Turn the back of tank AWAY from oncoming fire.
   + Use the Chimera as a temporary shield for infantry


+ DO NOT back up into an area where you just deployed troops or you might run them over.
 + Chimera can deal with infantry, but if there is enemy tank, call for backup (or switch to the autocannon if you are good enough.) DO NOT directly engage enemy tank unless necessary. You're a troop transport, NOT a main battle tank (MBT).

 + Friendlies can now ride in the chimera’s new gunner seats. Look for sitprims with translucent white bounding boxes. Militia and cultists can always ride, but other groups will have to be authed with the /1 auth:GROUPSUUIDGOESHERE command. Accept the takecontrols request as well as the temp attach for the hull gun in order to use it.

 + Stick around the spawn for at least 20 seconds if not under fire to collect passengers/gunners. Ask for gunners first as they have greater visibility/versatility. YOU ARE ALWAYS MORE EFFECTIVE AS A TEAM.

 + Alternatively, typing /1 beacon in local within a few meters of your deployment zone will allow you to place a teleport beacon. Users sitting on the beacon will be teleported immediately to an empty passenger seat. The beacon can do this 6 times before it requires recharging. The chimera recharges the beacon by moving to within a few meters of it.

+ AS INFANTRY PASSENGERS, you are allowed to shoot out from your passenger positions to assist in clearing areas and objectives. Do not use raycast weapons to fire out of the chimera, as you will hit the vehicle you are riding in.

### Movement
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Drive around base to get used to the movement. Chimera can easily climb up steep slopes. It has sensitive turning, however, and will easily tip over like a turtle.
+ Give them tips on more delicate areas (eg. steep hills, trench lines, places where they can easily get stuck.)
+ Speeds up over time with REAL MOMENTUM! Make sure they are used to navigating over weirdly shaped hills and obstacles so that they get an idea with how the chimera reacts climbing and descending obstacles.
+ Demonstrate (or at least explain) the Chimera's amphibious ability, just drive into some water.
 + If an EM is on, you can ask for the water level to be raised temporarily.


+ Keep tank moving, avoiding constant streams of fire.
 + Use cover much like infantry movement.
   + You can squish enemies (and friendlies) with front area of tank.

### Repairs
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Tanks can be repaired by Mechanicus Techaxe and general repair tool. If repair is possible, they should seek out cover and not move during repairs; moving can kill the repairman.
+ The rear of the Chimera is safest area to begin repairs.
 + Demonstrate this by getting behind them and asking them to move backwards. Do the same going forwards.
 + The rear of the Chimera generally is not lethal to collide into because people come out of it when it is being used as a transport.

+ If your tank is flipped somehow and unable to move, you may, if possible:
 + Activate the auto-flip function (this is the most reliable option).
 + Request infantry to help flip you by rezzing deployables beneath you (barricades and tank traps work best).
 + Request other tanks to help flip you by physically pushing your vehicle.
 + Attempt to rez your own deployable under your tank to flip yourself back up
   + this is the most difficult method, remove the deployable once successful


+ Teleport home

+ DO NOT RE-REZ YOUR VEHICLE! DIE! SERIOUSLY!
 + this is shitty to do and bad form


+ TIME FOR DEATH!? Here are some things you MAY do if you are flipped and cannot right yourself:
 + Continue engaging opposition until death.
   + (have them practice firing while flipped, controls are reversed)

 + Teleport home.
 + Manually detonate using the cultist bomb belt ('P' key.), because why not. (Note: may not work. Teleport home after doing so as you are dead inside the vehicle)

### Turrets
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Autocannon Turret
 + Fires at a decent ROF with two round types, HE and AP.
   + HE has a wider explosion radius, ideal for infantry.
   + AP deals 7 AT per shot, 5 on a splash.
   + HE deals 3 AT on a direct hit.
   + "Alter" Fires an alternating belt of HE and AP rounds.
   + Rounds have a chance to ignite scripted objects.
 + Switch rounds with "1" key.
 + Decent for fighting light vehicles if you can take advantage of the Chimera's speed, but generally not a great anti-infantry choice.


+ Bolter Turret
 + A rapid-fire twin-linked heavy bolter.
 + Acts like the hull-mounted bolter, except it fires in every direction and fires two rounds per mouse-click.
 + Has a reload feature:
   + You are encouraged to fire in short bursts rather than engage in prolonged suppression, otherwise, you will be unable to fire and will have to await the turret to reload the magazine.
 + No AT, only explosions.
 + Decent for quick bursts of suppression or can simply act as a bullet hose tank.
 + HIGHEST DAMAGE OUTPUT IN THE ARMORY for non-LBA armor.


+ Multi-Las Turret
 + Raycast machinegun. Delivers 1 AT per shot.
 + Useful for pinpoint shooting if you're a good shot on the move, and fires the shots rather rapidly.
 + Unlike Heavy Bolter, no reloading.
 + Has a lot of spread if you don’t control yourself.

### Further Training
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Do a few target practice runs with the tank, get creative with it to get them going in regards to having to move efficiently and fire at targets (why not both simultaneously,) and be sure to tell them they can look behind them and fire the turret AND fire the heavy bolter in front of them.

+ Demonstrate common ways to engage armor- IE, ram the other tank from its side while firing all weapons, duck in and out of cover, etc.

+ OPTIONAL: TANK SKIRMISH! First to 5 kills. Use if Renegade needs more practice.

+ Remember, Chimera can suppress, fight, transport, and acts as distraction mobile.

+ Hold C or another base control input while firing any vehicle weapon to fire faster because SL is fucking dumb.

## S3, III. Tank Training - The Hydra

+ Mobile anti-aircraft platform.
+ Aim main turret above chassis line to fire.
+ Flak is NOT group-safe. Be mindful where you aim.
+ Flak rounds operate as HE rounds on contact. Manipulate your chassis angle for additional anti-infantry capabilities.

### Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ W: Forward
+ A: Turn left
+ S: Reverse
+ D: Turn right
+ Mouse1: Fire turret
+ E: Fire Hull mount

### Training
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ The Hydra Flak Tank specializes in ground to air combat. It will fill the skies with highly explosive flak to take down both armoured and unarmoured flying vehicles. It is NOT group safe, so be mindful when firing into the skies, make sure there are no friendly air unit engaging enemy air vehicles before unloading payload.

+ It will also shred tall vehicles, mechs in particular, but do not expect to last very long if you go toe-to-toe with one, as heavier mechs are generally balanced to be as strong as MBTs, which you are most definitely not.

+ The chassis is exactly that of the Chimera, so it drives the same way, front heavy bolters included for defense should ground units attempt to engage you. The bolter is defensive, so stay behind something and make sure your front is facing the vector you are most likely to get shot at from.

+ It can be also be used against ground infantry (acts as explosive rounds rather than flak below certain height ceiling). However, the Hydra cannot fire below its chassis horizon, so be mindful of your angle of elevation to ensure continuous delivery of flak/explosive barrage. That means the Hydra is best used at low elevations, higher ground will gimp its horizon.

+ Alternatively, you can artificially lower your chassis horizon by parking on a ramp of some kind, or even halfway onto a slightly higher platform. If your ass is in the air, it means your front is open for business, and vice-versa.

+ Hold C (or some other control input) whilst firing to achieve max firerate. This is caused by a bug in SL.

+ If the driver asks you to get out of the hatch because your ass is in his face, kindly do so. Alternatively, if you are the driver, temporarily derendering the hatch gunner is probably a better idea.


## S3, III, P2. The Tauros Venator
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Lightly-armoured scout/harassment vehicle.
+ Not meant for sustained engagements, use hit-and-run tactics to succeed.
+ Must be used with a turret gunner. Drivers are, however, allowed to toss grenades and use **sidearms** whilst in the cockpit.

### Controls/Commands
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ WSAD to drive forwards, turns left/right, and reverse.
+ Hold C to activate the handbrake.
+ Mouse1 honks the horn.

### Available Turrets
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Autocannon
  + Twin-linked autocannon with HE, AP, and Flak rounds.


+ Lascannon
  + Twin-linked lascannon meant to deal heavy damage to full LBA vehicles

## S3, IV. Plane Training - The Avenger

+ Flying is HARD. [Say this.]
 + Flying well is HARDER.
 + Zalera’s dick is the HARDEST


+ Flight in the SLMC requires good framerates, meaning you need a decent computer, to be on a good sim, and to roll lucky with Linden Lab that day.

+ Note: As stated, not everyone has a good enough computer to handle air combat. Of those, some may not have any desire to perform air combat. IT IS PERMISSIBLE to allow the trainee to skip UNARMORED plane training. However, this MUST be marked on their tracker, and they are FORBIDDEN to deploy unarmored planes during combat operations. ARMORED aircraft training, including battlefleet training, must still be completed.

### Uses/Roles
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ It is not a dogfighting plane, it is to be used for anti-fleetship, anti-tank, anti-deployable, and anti-infantry use.
+ Note that it is not hopeless vs. dedicated interception craft, so long as you do not intend to kill your pursuers. For those skilled enough, focusing on evasive flying while STILL maintaining good effect on ground targets or armored aircraft, can be a highly effective tactic.
+ Use the Avenger as a reaction to enemy escalation, not as an escalation in and of itself.
 + For example, is a fleetship deployed? React w/ Avenger.


+ Swift heavy-hitting strike fighter, or ground attack fighter.
+ Can function as a dive bomber or precision bomber.
+ Armed with an Avenger Bolt Cannon, missile pods, multiple underwing bombs, and a rear-facing stubber emplacement.
+ The avenger is meant to be used by a pilot and a co-pilot as a rear gunner.

### Basic Controls & Operations
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Attach the current version, then press ~
+ The Avenger moves with constant forward motion, so you must be ready to pull up or maneuver right away.
+ Holding W and S will activate the afterburner to reach a maximum speed for a short period of swift maneuvering.
 + Base speed: 46 meters per second


+ W: Accelerate up to 64m/s
+ S: Decelerate down to 32m/s
+ W+S: Boost to 100m/s
+ C: Hold to activate 'Head look' mode.
 + While in this mode the horizon of your craft is locked and you cannot use the bolt cannon.
 + A and D will yaw the craft left and right.
 + W and S will pitch the craft down and up


+ 1 will change your munition type.
 + see below for Munition Types


+ 2 will deploy countermeasure flares.
 + see below for Flare Controls


+ This is a mouselook fighter, which means that most, if not all, your maneuvering will be performed using the mouse to bank and turn.
+ Rolling is automatic, and will return the horizon of your craft to an upright position when moving parallel to the ground.

### Munitions
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ HE BOMB
 + Explosive that does partial damage at a distance
 + 15 AT on a DIRECT hit to armor or 100% LL damage on a DIRECT hit to an avatar.


+ Concussive Torpedo
 + Deals 40 AT, launches forward and inherits your vehicle’s momentum
 + HARD TO AIM.


+ Hunter-Killer Missile
 + 40 AT, 10 on splash
 + locks on to ground-based seated armor.


+ Flak Chaff Canister
 + Exactly what it says on the tin.
 + Drops a bomb directly beneath the craft which explodes within about a second
 + Deploys a cloud of chaff that blocks enemy flak munitions.


+ Countermeasure Flares.

+ Mouse 1 fires the Avenger Bolt Cannon
 + It's nasty. Real nasty.
 + Delivers 5 AT per hit to enemy armor.


+ F will fire the munition currently selected.
+ E will fire the micro rockets. 100% LL Damage in small explosive radius.

### Live Fire Test
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ THEY MUST ELIMINATE A LEMAN RUSS TWICE AT 400 HP EACH. THEY WILL FAIL THE TEST IF THE FOLLOWING HAPPENS:
 + They obviously lose control 3 times
   + For instance, if they get stuck in an obstacle or start flipping/doing doughnuts.
 + They give up.


+ During the test, the trainee MUST hit the FIRST Leman Russ with each AT-capable munition, including at least one direct hit with a torpedo. It is recommended to sit still with the first Russ. For the second, start firing back with the coaxial stubber, as well as performing evasive maneuvers.


+ If they fail, it's up to you as to their punishment.
  + Recommended to make them restart the test from the beginning, or simply wait until the next day.


+ OPTIONAL: Create your own knowledge checkpoint like the one from S2, III, P7. For instance, perhaps challenge them to fight a Chimera on foot? Kill a fleetship with the Avenger? Build on the knowledge of before and what the Renegade has struggled on.


## CHECKPOINT

- This concludes the Renegade Vehicle Training. The recruit must now chose a division below (Section 4 for Ferrum/Heavy Support, or Section 5 for Mortis/Fast Attack) And complete it in its entirety.

- At this time the recruit is only required to complete ONE of these training sections but if you both chose, you can do both now and save time later.

## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

I. Advanced Tactics Orientation

II. Advanced Infantry Equipment

## S4, I. Advanced Tactics Orientation

### Read the following:
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ In Chaos, there are a couple different major doctrines we rely on, that more than a few of us end up falling into. The nuances of how you play are ultimately up to you, but you may want to consider the tactical applications of these doctrines when determining your overall strategy on the field, or how to utilize the men and women available to you when leading a raid. These two doctrines are "Fast Assault" and "Heavy Support".

+ The Heavy Support Doctrine relies on heavy vehicles, explosives, and suppressing fire to maintain pressure, secure, and **fortify** positions. Acting in the Heavy Support role is not just about your gear, it is about the mentality you’re in when you enter the fight. This is not limited to being "In the rear with the gear", so to speak (otherwise we'd never gain ground), but performing a slow, grinding advance of heavily fortified and entrenched positions until the enemy has no ground left is a powerful way to play.

+ Conversely, the Fast Assault Doctrine relies on quick, decisive strikes at key locations, rolling in and deploying entire squads with the Chimera or Valkyrie, harassing heavily armored vehicles with hit-and-run tactics, skirmishing with enemy infantry to clear them from their own positions, all to gain that initial chink in the enemy's armor for Heavy Support to fully exploit.

+ If you do decide to adopt one of these doctrines (which is again highly recommended), then above all, remember to **be flexible**. If we only have people doing Heavy Support things, for instance, playing passively is not going to get us anywhere. Clear an area and put a warp gate behind cover, seek and destroy enemy artillery: do not get stuck in one way of fighting.

+ Further to the last point, remember that teamwork makes the dream work. If you are showboating in melee or something while all the friendlies around you are dying and an entire push is being blunted, while that's cool and all, very impressive, you soon won't have any buddies covering your ass. You will get flanked, you will be ganged up on, and you will be swiftly eliminated. Do not shame the group, your corruptor, or yourself in this manner. Support your team.

### Re-iterate use of deployables in HUD
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Heavy Support makes more use of deployables than Fast Assault.
+ Barricades, DADS, Barbwires, Sandbags, warp gates, mines, EVERYTHING in your HUD is to be used in full force when you're fortifying an area.
 + Use some areas on sim as examples. Make it clear that you don't need to be specifically defending objectives
 + Emphasize landmines as a way to passively defend fortified locations until you can get back to them in the case that you die. If you aren't actively tossing a grenade at some asshole, you should be looking for a good spot to place a mine or deployable. If the cooldown on deployables or grenades is off for longer than a minute or so, you're probably Doing It Wrong.
 + Many sims have areas of high cover that allow us to fortify more easily and stage attacks.
 + BACK-UP WARP GATES! In the heavy support role, you are primarily responsible for keeping our soldiers in the fight. If nobody has a backup placed, it is YOUR JOB to ensure one is there. Call it out.

### Re-explain the Rocket Launcher and Repair tool
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Specifically, how Heavy Support is more easily able to seeker-rocket aircraft from the backline and how repairing deployables can be more useful than asking someone to replace them, or having them remember to replace them on death.
+ Use a repair tool to assist Mechanicus when possible. Fix barricades, turrets, and generators. The turrets in particular reload faster when that function is triggered manually, so be a good boy.

### Deployment Tactics
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Impress upon the Renegade the importance of Fast Assault opening a hole in a line. This means quickly advancing and using every tool at their disposal to open up an opportunity for everyone else to move forward.

+ This includes, when permitted, setting up FORWARD Warp Gates and COMMUNICATING with the rest of the group when the warp gate is ready to be used. When the gate is in a safe position, half the current raid/defense team entering an area can very quickly turn the tide of a fight.

+ Take the initiative. Can a bike, chimera, hellblade, or valkyrie be used in this situation to even the odds? ASK TO USE IT! Do mines need to be cleared on an objective? Use krak grenades or krak rockets. Be the first one to solve a problem or suggest a solution.


## S4, II. Advanced Infantry Equipment

### Basic hud utilities, equipment, and additional weapons
{: .no_toc .text-delta }


+ Heavy Stubber
 + High rpm, varying ammo capacity (/1mag). [160 Drum or 80 Box]
 + Higher ammo capacity, lower accuracy, longer reload time.
 + Entrenchment mode
   + Sit on barricade or activate with 'C' on cover you can see over
   + Higher accuracy.
   + Deactivates when unsat, moving, or looking up or down too far.
 + This is probably going to be your go-to weapon early on for the Heavy Support role. You can use it on the move, of course, but it **really** shines when deployed in a fortified location, such as on a barricade overlooking a major enemy thoroughfare with ample DADS and Bomb Umbrella cover.


+ Mortis Pattern Autopistol
  + Make sure the trainee understands the spread of the weapon.
  + Has less ammo than Voss autopistol (20 instead of 30).
  + Is more accurate than Voss autopistol.
  + Has a higher firerate than Voss autopistol.
  + This is going to again be a go-to sidearm for doing Fast Assault things. It's quick, both in firerate and on reload, and very good for performing snap-shot sprays at fuckers downrange.

### S4, II, P2. The Assault Bike

#### Paraphrase/teach the following
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Assault Bike
 + Explain to them the difference between the armored and unarmored version of the bike and to not use the unarmored version.
 + After that explain all the different lances (Explain the ones that are currently out).
 + Finally explain the main tactics of using the bike for Interception, Distraction, and Spearheading.

#### Movement & Controls
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Attach and press ~ to deploy
+ Controls in or out mouselook
 + but you can only use the lance IN mouselook so that’s better


+ W: Forward
+ A: Turn left
+ D: Turn right
+ S: Back up
+ E: Holding while moving lifts the front tire off of the ground
 + Which is useful for getting over shit

#### Roles of the Assault Bike
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Interception
 + The bike as an interceptor is to stop enemy vehicles or fast moving targets from moving across the field any further than they are.


+ Distraction
 + The bike is a perfect distraction to infantry and vehicles to draw their fire so other group members can assist in taking down the enemy targets.


+ Spearhead
 + The bikes can punch into enemy fortifications and cause chaos inside their defenses, push through in order to intercept & distract the enemy defenses to have the rest of Mortis and Ferrum move in.

#### Weapons and Munitions
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Lances
 + Make sure your other weapons are put away (set 4)
 + Simply attach the lance, left click in mouselook to throw, or hold to have it auto-throw if an object or surface comes into range.
 + Lance will “reload” after a few seconds


+ One-handed weapons
 + You are allowed to use ONE one-handed weapon on the assault bike.


+ Grenades and mines
 + You may toss grenades and mines while riding the assault bike.
   + Mines MUST be tossed, NOT placed!


+ NOTHING ELSE MAY BE USED WHILE RIDING THE ASSAULT BIKE. STOP ASKING.

#### Courses & Knowledge Check
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Bike VS DADS

    Have them drive around and use the lance on stationary D.A.D.S you put out.
    After lance practice have them then move to using Krak and Melta grenades

+ Bike VS Bike

    first do a few rounds with you as ground and have them both lance and grenade you.
    If they focus more on one, have them only use the other until they get use to it.
    Get them used to fast moving targets attacking them

+ Bike VS Tank

    Have another member of Chaos help you by hopping into a 200HP LBA Leman Russ.
    Have them use either grenades or their lance to take down the tank


## S4, II, P3. The Hellblade

### Pre-training
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Check that the trainee has the optimal FPS to partake in air combat.
 + An ideal FPS would be between 30 - 40. The higher the better.
 + To check FPS, use CTRL + SHIFT + 1


+ The hellblade does backblast damage so watch where you’re flying!
 + It also does damage to everyone if you hover over them at 7 meters or less.
   + Which is ~~funny sometimes~~ absolutely hilarious, every time.


+ Update: The hellblade no longer has backblast damage because Dread hates fun or something.

### Basic Controls and Commands
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Attach and press ~ to deploy
 + Or /1 rez


+ /1 reset: Forces a script restart.
+ 1: Toggles between the three missile munition types.
+ 2: Fires flares! You have 4 flares before they have to reload, at 4 seconds per flare expended.
+ F: If using a seeking missile, activates the detection sweep to lock on, and then fires once locked on. Otherwise, fires your munition.
+ R: Reload munitions.
+ Shift+1: Activate soft-lock missile. This will automatically seek out and attempt to destroy the nearest aircraft that passes within a certain radius of the warhead. Notably, this can cross sim borders, and is only usable on multi-sim combat fields as the seeking method arguably would render the classic AA missile obsolete.
+ Shift+2: Reload flares only.
+ Q: Hotswap back to flakk missiles.

### Movement
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Plane controls in mouselook
+ W moves forward
+ Control turning/pitching with mouse
 + It takes a lot of getting used to, spend as much time as they need on this part, have them follow you around the sim. Fly over, under, and around shit until they get the hang of it


+ W+S activates afterburners (boost)
 + Fly into the sim border with this to avoid getting hit by seekers ;^)
 + 8 second boost, 5 second recharge


+ The red square is where your pointed/facing so if you get turned around just find the square

### Munitions
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

+ Shell Munitions
 + Hellblade Pulse
   + Basic ballistic munitions, for use against ground or armored targets.
   + Fire with left mouse click
   + You have unlimited ammo.


+ Missile Munitions
 + Frag Rocket
   + Air to Ground missiles, exactly as in the Infantry Rocket Launcher
   + 4 rounds in the magazine.
 + Krak Rocket
   + Air to Ground missiles, exactly as in the Infantry Rocket Launcher
   + 4 rounds in the magazine.
 + Flakk Missile
   + Air to Air missiles, 25 AT Homing AAMS
   + Press F to activate, once you’re locked on press F again to fire.
   + Locked target will show in chat, if you accidentally lock onto one of us, hit R to reload. Always double check who you're locked on before you fire.
   + Cancel lock on by pressing F
   + 4 rounds in the magazine.
  + Concussive Torpedo
   + Air to Ground bomb, 80 AT on direct hit, 20 on splash, 10m radius
   + 2 rounds in the magazine.

### Hellblade Duel
